Did the district court abuse its discretion by denying class certification where Plaintiffs failed to offer a working econometric model for proving that antitrust impact was a common issue, making it impossible for the district court to discharge its duty to rigorously scrutinize such proof, but instead offered theories of potential harm that their expert intends to later develop? If there is a remand, should this case be reassigned to a different district court judge?
