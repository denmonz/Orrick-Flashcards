DISCLOSURE OF CORPORATE AFFILIATIONS AND OTHER INTERESTS
Disclosures must be filed on behalf of all parties to a civil, agency, bankruptcy or mandamus case, except that a disclosure statement is not required from the United States, from an indigent party, or from a state or local government in a pro se case. In mandamus cases arising from a civil or bankruptcy action, all parties to the action in the district court are considered parties to the mandamus case.
Corporate defendants in a criminal or post-conviction case and corporate amici curiae are required to file disclosure statements.
If counsel is not a registered ECF filer and does not intend to file documents other than the required disclosure statement, counsel may file the disclosure statement in paper rather than electronic form. Counsel has a continuing duty to update this information.

Unable To Readily Identify Class Members, The Court
Enters An Aggregate Judgment	12
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT	14
ARGUMENT	19
I.	The Class Must Be Decertified And The Judgment
Vacated Because The Class Is Fatally Overbroad.	19
A.	Krakauer defined the class to include numerous
improper plaintiffs.	21
The class definition comprises non-

subscribers who have no possible claim.	21
The class definition comprises individuals
who lack Article III standing.	28
B.	The district court erred by certifying the overbroad class, and doubly so by not requiring
any mechanism to weed out uninjured plaintiffs.	31
1.	Certification was improper because the
class definition is impermissibly overbroad.	31
i

Alternatively, the class must be decertified because Krakauer identified no
administratively feasible mechanism to
limit recovery to proper plaintiffs.	32
The district court failed to limit the
judgment to those who prove liability. 	34
II.	The Court Failed To Instruct The Jury To Determine
Whether Each Class Member Received Two Calls
Within A Year.	 38
III. No Reasonable Jury Could Find DISH Liable For The
Calls Made By SSN.	40
SSN was not DISH’s agent.	41
Even if SSN were DISH’s agent, it exceeded its
authority when it made these calls.	54
IV.	The Treble-Damages Award Must Be Overturned.	 58
A.	The damages must be vacated because the district court made two legal errors in applying
the willful-or-knowing standard.	60
The court applied the wrong legal standard
when it imputed SSN’s conduct to DISH.	60
The court applied a legally incorrect
standard for willful conduct.	62
B.	The damages must be reversed because DISH did
not willfully violate the TCPA as a matter of law.	65
DISH reasonably believed, based on its contracts with SSN and compliance measures, that it had satisfied its legal
obligations.	66
DISH did not disregard a substantial risk that SSN was placing tens of thousands of
Registry calls in 2010 and 2011.	68

INTRODUCTION
In this upside-down case, the wrong plaintiffs recovered from the
wrong defendant.
Start with the plaintiffs. Thomas Krakauer brought this case as a class action, alleging that DISH violated the Do Not Call provisions of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA). Ultimately, the court entered aggregate judgment for more than 18,000 claimants, to the tune of over $60 million: $1,200 for each time an independent retailer (not DISH) called a number that someone placed on the National Do Not Call Registry.
So who were these lucky class members? That’s the first problem. Krakauer didn’t limit his class to telephone subscribers, the people protected by the TCPA. Nor to people who actually received calls or somehow were harmed. The court certified a class of anyone “associated with” a phone number called by the retailer, Satellite Systems Network (SSN). That impermissibly broad class definition encompasses au pairs, former boyfriends, and children who have long since moved away—indeed, potentially anyone ever linked to the phone number. And the court never required Krakauer to prove that

1

whichever person claimed damages ever received a call. By definition, therefore, the class includes plaintiffs with no cause of action.
Worse still, it shouldn’t have been DISH in the dock. DISH didn’t make the calls. Every call was made by SSN. SSN isn’t DISH’s alias or an alter ego. It is one of thousands of independent retailers, like RadioShack, that market DISH’s satellite TV subscriptions. Year after year, DISH and SSN signed contracts specifying that SSN is an independent contractor and limiting SSN’s authority. SSN ran its own business, using its own marketing expertise, subject only to contractual standards and quality control from DISH—including numerous reminders of SSN’s contractual obligation to follow telemarketing laws. It was SSN that decided to make each of the calls, based on sales leads that SSN purchased—just like it did working for other companies, including DISH’s biggest competitor.
DISH isn’t legally responsible for the actions of a rogue contractor. Every authority, from the Restatements to the Supreme Court, makes this clear. And at a bare minimum, DISH’s reasonable understanding that SSN was an independent contractor forecloses the decision to treble damages to $60 million.

2

So how did this happen? Because the court accepted Krakauer’s repeated refrain that DISH simply had to be punished. Krakauer urged the court to ignore niceties: There “is a telephone number that is on the [Do Not Call] registry, and there was a call placed by SSN, ... and the call was connected.... DISH should not benefit from the fact that we can’t find out who that person is right now.” JA__[Sept.8Hr’gTr.at36] (emphasis added). The court acknowledged that the jury never “determine[d] the identity of the persons who received the calls.” JA__[Doc.351at7]. But it was single-mindedly focused on deterring DISH—even if that meant holding DISH liable “for damages owed to injured class members who cannot be found.” JA__[Doc.351at24] (emphasis added).
The proper solution was for the court to correctly define the class, and for Krakauer to sue the party that made the calls. As he did below, Krakauer will paint DISH as a bad actor that simply must be punished. But even if his accusations were true—and DISH vehemently disputes them—they provide no legal justification for the shortcuts taken here. The class should be decertified, and the judgment vacated or reversed.

3

JURISDICTION
The district court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331 and
1332(d)(2). On April 5, 2018, the court entered judgment, JA__[Doc.439], thereby implicating 28 U.S.C. § 1291. DISH filed a timely notice of appeal. JA__[Doc.456].
STATEMENT OF ISSUES
Section 227(c)(5) of the TCPA creates a private right of action
for telephone subscribers. Article III of the U.S. Constitution requires that a plaintiff suffered concrete injury to have standing. Did the court err by failing to limit the class definition to phone subscribers; by failing to limit the class definition to people who suffered concrete injury; and by failing to require Krakauer to ultimately prove that class members were harmed?
To recover under § 227(c)(5), a single person must receive two calls within a year. Did the court incorrectly instruct the jury on this element?
The contract between DISH and SSN expressly disclaimed an agency relationship and barred SSN from violating telemarketing laws. DISH also instructed SSN to follow Do Not Call laws generally, and not

4

to call Krakauer specifically. Did the court err in holding DISH responsible for SSN’s calls on the theory that SSN was DISH’s agent? And even if SSN were DISH’s agent, did the court err in holding that SSN’s unlawful calls fell within the scope of any agency relationship?
4. The TCPA authorizes treble damages only when the defendant knowingly or willfully violated the statute. Did the district court misinterpret the legal standard for knowing or willful conduct, and err as a matter of law in determining that DISH’s conduct met that standard?
STATEMENT OF THE CASE
DISH Contracts With An Independent Company, SSN, To Market Satellite TV Subscriptions
DISH is one of the largest pay-television providers in the country. To help market its satellite TV subscription service, DISH contracts with thousands of independent retailers. JA__[Jan.13Tr.at157-58]. SSN was one such retailer. JA__[JTX1at1, Jan.11Tr.at162, 208, 219]. DISH’s contracts with retailers contain standards and guidelines for how retailers should market DISH’s products. See JA__[JTX1at1, 6, 911, 17-18] (retailer agreement). But the retailers operate independently: They maintain their own offices, hire their own

5

employees, create their own marketing strategies (e.g., TV, radio, print, telemarketing, etc.), and even market DISH’s competitors. See JA__[Jan.11Tr.at217-21; JTX1at1]. Thus, SSN’s contract specified in bold, capital letters that it was an “INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR” that would “market, promote and solicit [DISH] orders” on a “nonexclusive basis.” JA__[JTX1at1, 21]. Engaging independent contractors is common, it’s lawful, and it’s good business: It allows one company to leverage other companies’ specialized skills and greater efficiency.
DISH works to ensure that its contractors comply with the law, among other reasons, because telemarketing violations damage DISH’s business and brand. JA__[DX9] (compliance letter to SSN); JA__[Jan.13Tr.at172-75, Jan.12Tr.at90, 132]. Thus, the contract between DISH and SSN required SSN to comply with the law, and made SSN “solely responsible” for doing so. JA__[JTX1at18]. DISH also has a compliance program with dedicated employees who remind retailers of their legal obligations, and who address consumer complaints. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at95-97, 126-28; Jan.13Tr.at170-72; DX2, 3, 9, 28].

6

From 2006 to May 2010—the four years preceding the class period—SSN made millions of calls marketing DISH services. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at86]. Yet DISH received only five complaints from those calls claiming that SSN called someone whose phone number was on the National Do Not Call Registry. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at87; DX9(Krakauer); PX15atDISH-Paper-008042(Fisher); PX15atDISH-Paper-008037(Mitchell); PX15atDISH-Paper-008035(Payne); PX52(Campbell)] (DISH’s responses to complaints).
As DISH’s compliance manager explained, a number that low indicates a retailer is generally “following the letter of the law.” JA__[Jan.12Tr.at100-01, 114-15]. It suggests isolated “human error” and “innocent” mistakes rather than systemic disregard of the Do Not Call Registry. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at102]. DISH investigated each complaint, instructed SSN to add the complaining individual to SSN’s internal Do Not Call list, and reiterated that SSN must comply with telemarketing laws. See, e.g., JA__[PX15atDISH-Paper-008042(Fisher)].

7

SSN Defies DISH’s Instructions And Calls Krakauer
One of the five complaints concerned a call to Thomas Krakauer.
In 2003, Krakauer had ordered DirecTV service from SSN.
JA__[DX81], JA__[Jan.11Tr.at33]. By 2009, SSN no longer marketed DirecTV services, and it called Krakauer to persuade him to switch to DISH. In the interim, however, Krakauer had put his phone number on the Registry. JA__[Jan.11Tr.at9-12].
Krakauer complained to DISH, and DISH promptly investigated. Its investigation revealed SSN had made the call. JA__[PX282at1]. So DISH notified SSN and requested details about SSN’s conduct— including how SSN obtained the number, and when SSN had last “scrubbed” its call list to remove numbers on the Registry. JA__[DX9]. DISH instructed SSN to “immediately ensure that [Krakauer’s] phone number has been added to” SSN’s internal list of numbers not to call. And DISH warned SSN that “[a]dditional incidences of this nature may result in disciplinary action up to and including termination of your Retailer Agreement.” JA__[DX9]; see JA__[Jan.12Tr.at107-10].
SSN responded the very next day with a reasonable explanation: It believed Krakauer’s prior purchase of DirecTV service created an

8

“Established Business Relationship” (EBR) with him. JA__[DX8at1; Jan.12Tr.at112]. When an EBR exists, a marketer may call a number on the Registry. 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(f)(14)(ii). SSN also said it took corrective action: It reviewed the incident with a sales manager and added Krakauer’s number to its internal Do Not Call list. JA__[DX8at1-2; Jan.12Tr.at110-12]. And it reiterated to DISH that “[w]e always comply with National Do Not Call Policies and ... take Do Not Call violations very seriously.” JA__[DX8at2]. SSN said it wouldn’t call Krakauer again. JA__[DX8at1-2]. DISH then reported to Krakauer what it had found. JA__[Jan.11Tr.at41].
Unbeknownst to DISH, however, SSN ignored DISH and repeatedly called Krakauer from May 2010 to August 2011. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at184-85]. It turned out SSN had been secretly flouting the Registry, and the calls to Krakauer were just the start. From May 2010 to August 2011, SSN made thousands of calls to numbers on the Registry. JA__[Doc.407at1]. Although SSN had placed more than 1.6 million calls during the class period to offer DISH services, JA__[Doc.110at4], DISH didn’t receive a single complaint

9

from an SSN call recipient based on those calls, JA__[Jan.12Tr.at138], including from Krakauer, JA__[Jan.11Tr.at41-42, 45].
Krakauer Sues DISH, And The Jury Ultimately Finds DISH Liable For SSN’s Calls
In April 2014, Krakauer sued DISH (not SSN) under the TCPA. He purported to represent a class of “[a]ll persons ... whose telephone numbers were listed on the [Registry] for at least 30 days, but who received telemarketing calls from [SSN], to promote [DISH] from May 1, 2010 to August 1, 2011.” JA__[Doc.47at1].1

At class certification, Krakauer’s expert relied on SSN call records to identify what she said were more than 50,000 calls to residential landlines made by SSN during the class period to some 20,000 phone numbers on the Registry. JA__[Doc.48-2at11-12]. DISH opposed certification, arguing that the class went beyond the relevant group of people—phone subscribers. Indeed, Krakauer didn’t even have subscriber information: The records reflecting the numbers called by
1 Krakauer also was a featured witness in United States v. DISH Network L.L.C., a telemarketing enforcement action brought by the United States and four states. No. 09-cv-3073 (C.D. Ill.). The verdict favoring plaintiffs in that case is on appeal to the Seventh Circuit, No. 17-3111.

10

SSN didn’t identify subscribers (and Krakauer never sought discovery to identify them). See JA__[Doc.48at10-12]. Krakauer instead relied on private databases that reflected any name—often multiple names— “associated with” phone numbers that SSN called. JA__[Doc.48at15]. But those databases didn’t even show whether the named individuals used the number at the time the calls were made, much less whether they actually received telemarketing calls from SSN. JA__[Doc.56at15-16]. The court nevertheless certified the class. JA__[Doc.111].
Two key issues dogged the ensuing trial.
First, Krakauer had to prove that SSN was acting as DISH’s agent when it made the calls. JA__[Doc.293at4-8] (jury instructions). Thus, he had to overcome, among other things, the language in the DISH/SSN Retailer Agreements, and DISH’s express instructions not to call Krakauer and other registered numbers. Second, Krakauer had to prove that each class member “received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period.” 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5). But Krakauer offered no evidence that any class members (other than himself) were telephone subscribers or personally received telemarketing calls during the class period. The court deemed such evidence unnecessary. It

11

“remove[d] from the upcoming trial” the question of who received the calls. JA___[Doc.242at1].
The jury ultimately awarded $400 for each call placed by SSN to the still-unidentified class members. JA__[Doc.292at1-2]. That amounted to some $20 million, which the district court then tripled. Treble damages are available only for willful or knowing violations of the TCPA. 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5)(C). The court made that finding after concluding that SSN’s conduct could be imputed to DISH, and that DISH should have known of TCPA violations that SSN committed before the class period. JA__[Doc.338at23]. On that basis, the court increased damages to $1,200 for each phone call. JA__[Doc.338at28-31]. Because a statutory violation requires a plaintiff to have received two calls, the court awarded each plaintiff at least $2,400—with many set to receive $10,000 and up. JA__[Doc.390-1at31].
Unable To Readily Identify Class Members, The Court Enters An Aggregate Judgment
Notwithstanding the verdict, the class members still had not been identified. Neither the jury nor the court had determined who received the calls, much less whether they were subscribers. For that reason, the court initially declined to enter judgment. JA__[Doc.351at13-15].

12

It acknowledged that DISH had not had an opportunity to litigate whether identifiable people received the calls, and found that “[a]s a matter of fairness and ‘basic due process,’” DISH was entitled to do so. JA__[Doc.351at14]. The court decided to leave those determinations to “some sort of claims process.” JA__[Sept.8Hr’gTr.at67-68]; see JA__[Sept.8Hr’gTr.at64-66; June3Tr.at113; Doc.293at14]. DISH believed no post-trial process could cure the errors from class certification and trial, but nonetheless proposed that each claimant complete a form and submit evidence that they were a subscriber or actually received two or more calls. JA__[Doc.330at3-4, 12].
The court denied DISH’s request, then (notwithstanding its prior ruling) started the process of entering judgment while the claims process was ongoing. It concluded that approximately 11,000 class members were adequately identified in Krakauer’s records—the same records that only identified individuals “associated with” numbers—and precluded DISH from challenging whether those people had a valid claim. JA__[Doc.407at1] (“[T]he identities of these class members are not reasonably subject to dispute.”). DISH would not be permitted to challenge whether a named individual was the phone-line subscriber,

13

actually received the calls, or even was in the household of someone who received them. Nor could DISH challenge whether the phone number had changed hands. The identities of the remaining 7,000 class members would be established through claim forms, JA__[Doc.407at12; Doc.441at6], but the court’s form did not ask the claimant to identify the telephone subscriber, or who answered any call. JA__[Doc.361at3]. The court then entered an aggregate class judgment. JA__[Doc.438at2].
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
I.	A court may not certify a class when the class definition
includes people who cannot have a valid claim, including because they have no standing. And even when the court has properly granted certification, the plaintiff must identify a way to ensure that only those with valid claims recover. The district court certified a class that violated these basic rules.
A.	The class was overbroad in two ways.
1.	The court certified a class that includes non-subscribers. Non-subscribers, however, are categorically unable to state a claim under § 227(c). The text and structure of the TCPA make clear

14

that only subscribers fall within the zone of interests Congress sought to protect. It is subscribers who have rights to telephone numbers, and subscribers who are authorized to say they don’t want to “receive” calls by placing their numbers on the Registry. The district court erroneously certified a much broader class that includes anyone “associated with” a phone number called by SSN.
2.	This “associated with” class also includes people who lack standing. To satisfy Article III, a plaintiff must have suffered actual or threatened injury. The class definition, however, does not require that a class member be a subscriber, answer a phone call, hear the phone ring, or even live at the residence to which a call was placed. Such people suffer no conceivable injury.
B.	Because the class definition includes categories of plaintiffs with no conceivable claim, the class must be decertified and the judgment vacated.
1.	It is impermissible to certify a class defined to include a significant number of people who could not recover—whether because they lack a valid claim or lack standing to bring one.

15

It also is impermissible to certify a class unless the plaintiff identifies an administratively feasible mechanism to demonstrate, with common proof, which plaintiffs have a right to recover. Krakauer never explained how he would show who is a subscriber or was otherwise injured by a violation.
And, in fact, he never did so. Even a properly certified class cannot recover unless the court ensures that each plaintiff established liability. Here, however, the court allowed Krakauer to proceed through trial and claims administration without ever showing that any class member was a subscriber or actual call recipient.
II.	Next, the judgment must be vacated because the court improperly instructed the jury on § 227(c)(5)’s requirement that each plaintiff “received more than one telephone call” within a year. That element requires proof that each person received at least two calls. The court, however, instructed the jury that it need only find SSN made two calls to the same number. But numbers commonly change hands, so two calls to a number is not the same thing as two calls received by a single person.

16

III. Alternatively, the verdict must be reversed outright because DISH is not liable for SSN’s actions. DISH cannot be liable unless
SSN possessed actual authority to act as DISH’s agent; and
SSN’s telemarketing violations fell within the scope of that actual authority.
For actual authority to exist, both parties must assent to an agency relationship, and the principal must control the agent. Here, the written agreements between DISH and SSN expressly rejected any agency relationship. DISH repeatedly reminded SSN it was not an agent. And the court acknowledged that DISH did not have day-to-day control over SSN’s operations.
Even if there were an agency relationship, no reasonable jury could find SSN acted within the scope of any authority it had. DISH repeatedly and unambiguously instructed SSN not to call Krakauer, and to comply with telemarketing laws. To uphold the verdict, the district court pointed to generalized evidence that (the court thought) suggested employees in DISH’s compliance department failed to adequately supervise SSN. But failing to supervise someone doesn’t establish control over them—if anything, it shows a lack of control. And

17

certainly it does not constitute authorization to violate the law,
especially in the face of unambiguous instructions to comply with the law.
IV.	Last, the treble-damages award cannot stand.
The district court’s trebling decision rests on two legal errors. First, the court mistakenly believed SSN’s conduct could be “imputed to DISH.” But a principal is liable only for compensatory, not enhanced, damages based solely on the conduct of the supposed agent.
Second, the court erred when it looked to DISH’s own conduct. It applied a watered-down negligence standard rather than the demanding willfulness standard mandated by the Supreme Court—i.e., knowing disregard of a risk “substantially greater than that which is necessary to make ... conduct negligent.” Safeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 68-69 (2007).
Under the proper standard, DISH did not act willfully as a matter of law. Even when a defendant’s conduct is ultimately determined to be illegal, it is not willful if it is consistent with an objectively reasonable understanding of the law. And during the class period, no case, agency pronouncement, or regulation indicated that a

18

company is liable under the TCPA for calls it neither placed nor specifically directed an agent to place. Moreover, DISH had ample basis to believe that SSN was its independent contractor, not its agent.
Furthermore, for the full range of violations to be willful, DISH would have had to know that SSN posed an unjustifiably high risk of committing all of them. Yet DISH did not receive a single complaint from an SSN call recipient based on calls SSN made during the class period. And the handful of complaints DISH received based on calls in the years before the class period do not establish DISH’s willfulness during the class period, let alone with respect to over 51,000 calls.
ARGUMENT
I.	The Class Must Be Decertified And The Judgment Vacated Because The Class Is Fatally Overbroad.
Class actions can be complicated, but they have some basic ground rules. Foremost among them is that a class cannot be defined to include people who could not recover. A class “defined so broadly as to include a great number of members who for some reason could not have been harmed ... is defined too broadly to permit certification.” Messner v. Northshore Univ. HealthSystem, 669 F.3d 802, 824-25 (7th Cir. 2012); see Denney v. Deutsche Bank AG, 443 F.3d 253, 264 (2d Cir. 2006) (a

19

class cannot be “defined in such a way” that it necessarily embraces people who “lack standing”). And an award in a class action “cannot stand” if “there is no way to ensure that [the] damages award goes only to injured class members.” Tyson Foods v. Bouaphakeo, 136 S. Ct. 1036, 1053 (2016) (Roberts, C.J., concurring).
The court certified a TCPA class of unprecedented breadth—one that included anyone merely “associated with” a phone number called by SSN that is on the Registry. JA__[Doc.111at11]. This definition encompassed thousands of improper plaintiffs who could not possibly state a claim, infra § I.A.1, and who lack the actual injury required for Article III standing, infra § I.A.2. The resulting class violated the foundational rules set forth above. And even if such a class could be certified, the court never required Krakauer to demonstrate that each putative plaintiff established liability. Infra § I.B. Accordingly, the judgment must be vacated and the class decertified.
We begin with the two errors in the composition of the class, then turn to the reasons they require decertification and vacatur.

20

A.	Krakauer defined the class to include numerous improper plaintiffs.
The TCPA creates a private right of action that may be brought by a “telephone subscriber”—the individual who is “responsible for payment of the telephone bill,” 47 C.F.R. § 64.1100(h), and therefore has a statutory right to object to telemarketing calls, see 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(c)(2). The district court certified a much broader class: people called by SSN who were “associated with” a phone number on the Registry. JA__[Doc.111at11]. This class is defined to encompass not just subscribers, but people with no conceivable claim—for instance, au pairs, former boyfriends, and children who have grown up and moved out. It also encompasses people who suffered no concrete injury—who weren’t subscribers, didn’t answer the phone, or didn’t even hear it ring—and therefore lack standing.
1.	The class definition comprises non-subscribers who have no possible claim.
a. Under the TCPA, “[a] person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection may” bring suit. 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5). But not just anyone can sue; “a

21

statutory cause of action extends only to plaintiffs whose interests fall within the zone of interests protected by the law invoked.” Lexmark Int’l v. Static Control Components, 572 U.S. 118, 129 (2014). Thus, a court must ask “whether a legislatively conferred cause of action encompasses a particular plaintiff’s claim.” Id. at 127; see also Leaf Tobacco Exps. Ass’n v. Block, 749 F.2d 1106, 1111 (4th Cir. 1984); In re Peeples, 880 F.3d 1207, 1213 (10th Cir. 2018).
Here, Congress protected the interests of telephone subscribers who wanted to avoid telemarketing calls. Section 227(c)’s very title is “Protection of subscriber privacy rights.” (emphasis added). Its first sentence instructs the FCC to prescribe regulations “to protect residential telephone subscribers’ privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object.” Id. § 227(c)(1) (emphasis added); accord id. § 227(c)(2). And the Do Not Call Registry is defined as a “database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations.” Id.
§ 227(c)(3) (emphasis added); see 68 Fed. Reg. 44,144, 44,144 (July 25, 2003) (“The TCPA requires the [FCC] to protect residential telephone

22

subscribers’ privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object.”).
Congress tied the cause of action to those same subscribers. A claim under § 227(c)(5) requires an underlying “violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection.” And the relevant regulation concerns subscribers; it is subscribers who can place their numbers on the Registry, and the regulation prohibits calls to a “residential telephone subscriber who has registered his or her telephone number” on the Registry. 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(c)(2). Indeed, even before the Registry was created, the regulation allowed only a “subscriber” to object to receiving calls by placing their number on companies’ internal Do Not Call lists. Id. § 64.1200(e) (1993); 57 Fed. Reg. 48,333, 48,333, 48,335-36 (Oct. 23, 1992).
Section 227(c) thus makes clear the injury it seeks to redress: not every last person’s mere annoyance at receiving a telemarketing call, but the particular injury that results when unwanted telemarketing calls are made to “residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations,” § 227(c)(3)—i.e., the harm to someone who “affirmatively [took] action to prevent such calls,” 137 Cong. Rec. 30818

23

(1991) (statement of Sen. Pressler, sponsor of the bill). Others who merely answer calls—a subscriber’s son visiting from college, or a houseguest—are not injured in the relevant way and have no claim based on calls to the subscriber’s number.
A contrary interpretation would work great mischief, creating multiple claimants for each telemarketing violation. This could create a race to judgment among eligible plaintiffs and risk double recovery against the defendant. Congress could not have intended this result.
b. The district court, however, concluded that § 227(c)(5) is “not limit[ed] ... to only subscribers.” JA__[Doc.111at13]. It certified a class that encompassed any person “associated with” a phone number on the Registry. JA__[Doc.111at11]. The court made clear that, under its “associated with” standard, non-subscribers may recover. JA__[Doc.111at13]. It reasoned that while § 227(c)(1)-(3) all pertain to “allowing subscribers to register their numbers,” JA__[Doc.111at12], § 227(c)(5) does not refer explicitly to subscribers but rather “[a] person who has received” calls, JA__[Doc.111at13].
This reasoning cannot be squared with the statutory text, which states that the “person” must suffer a “violation of the regulations

24

prescribed under this subsection.” As explained above (at 23), from their inception the implementing regulations have concerned the rights of “subscribers” who object to calls by placing their names on a Registry.
Lexmark also refutes the district court’s reliance on the statutory term “person.” The plaintiff in Lexmark sought to sue under the Lanham Act for false advertising, alleging that a misleading ad duped her into purchasing a disappointing product. 572 U.S. at 122-23. Much like here, the statute provided that “any person who believes that he or she is likely to be damaged” could sue. Id. at 129 (emphasis added). “Read literally, that broad language might suggest that an action is available to anyone ....” Id. Even so, the Court explained, the claim is available only to those Congress intended to protect—individuals suffering commercial harm to their reputation or sales. Id. at 131-32; see Peeples, 880 F.3d at 1215-16. And here, Congress intended to protect the subscriber whose desire to avoid telemarketing calls was ignored.
The district court also relied on cases interpreting a different provision, § 227(b)(3). That section creates a cause of action for “robocalls,” and some district courts have thought it available to any

25

robocall recipient. JA__[Doc.111at12-13] (citing cases). But “each provision of the [statute] must be analyzed individually to determine who falls within the scope of its protection.” Todd v. Collecto, Inc., 731 F.3d 734, 738 (7th Cir. 2013); see Morgan v. U.S. Xpress, 2018 WL 3580775, at *3 (W.D. Va. July 25, 2018). And § 227(b) is meaningfully different from § 227(c). It covers any robocall to any “residential telephone line”; makes no reference to residential subscribers or the Registry; and doesn’t require an individual to act to stop receiving robocalls. Id. § 227(b)(1)(B); 47 C.F.R. § 64.1200(a)(3). Section 227(b) was enacted through separate legislation and addresses a “different harm[]” governed by “a different set of rules.” Donaca v. DISH Network, LLC, 303 F.R.D. 390, 399 (D. Colo. 2014); see 137 Cong. Rec. 30822 (1991) (Sen. Hollings). Whatever one concludes about § 227(b)— and even there, authorities are divided2—it sheds little light on § 227(c).
2 Compare Gutierrez v. Barclays Grp., 2011 WL 579238, at *5 (S.D. Cal. Feb. 9, 2011) (“[T]he TCPA is intended to protect the telephone subscriber, and thus it is the subscriber who has standing to sue for violations of the TCPA.”).

26

c. The court’s “associated with” class necessarily included numerous non-subscribers. This is for the simple reason that multiple people often are “associated with” a phone number.
The district court based class membership, in part, on records from a vendor, Five9, which provided telemarketing software to SSN. JA__[Doc.351at2, PX18]. But those records don’t show whether a person was the subscriber. JA__[Doc.58-05at12-13; Doc.111at10-12; Doc.407at5, 12; PX18]. And many of the numbers in those records are “associated with multiple names”—only one of which could be the subscriber. JA__[Doc.56-12at14] (DISH expert Aron).
When the Five9 data didn’t supply a name, the court relied on a LexisNexis database—which also doesn’t identify subscribers, as LexisNexis itself confirmed. JA__[Doc.56-13at2]; see JA__[Doc.56-12at12] (DISH expert Aron). Any given record may come from “thousands of [different] sources,” including credit card applications, utilities, and even warranties. JA__[Doc.48-2at5&n.2]. Simply put: Whenever a subscriber’s ex-girlfriend, former roommate, au pair, or child previously filled out a credit-card application on which they listed the subscriber’s phone number (because they lived under that roof at

27

the time), and that association was captured in this database, each person would be “associated with” the number. The same even would be true of a former subscriber. But none would be the subscriber—the person with a statutory right to bring suit.
And for thousands of other numbers SSN called, anyone could attempt to self-verify their “association with” the number using a website (), without showing they were the subscriber. Even Krakauer’s class notice didn’t require confirmation that the person was the subscriber. JA__[Doc.141].
The class definition encompasses numerous people who have no statutory claim.
2.	The class definition comprises individuals who
lack Article III standing.
Even if the TCPA did permit anyone “associated with” a phone number to sue, the broad class certified here runs afoul of Article III because it includes people who suffered no concrete injury.
“[A]t an irreducible minimum, Art. III requires the party who invokes the court’s authority to show that he personally has suffered some actual or threatened injury as a result of the putatively illegal conduct of the defendant.” Valley Forge Christian Coll. v. Americans

28

United for Separation of Church & State, 454 U.S. 464, 472 (1982). This fundamental principle holds equally true in class actions. E.g., Halvorson v. Auto-Owners Ins. Co., 718 F.3d 773, 778-79 (8th Cir. 2013). And it “requires a concrete injury even in the context of a statutory violation.” Soehnlen v. Fleet Owners Ins. Fund, 844 F.3d 576, 582 (6th Cir. 2016) (quoting Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 136 S. Ct. 1540, 1549 (2016)). That is because the fact of a statutory violation does not necessarily establish actual injury. Id.; Groshek v. Time Warner Cable, 865 F.3d 884, 887 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. denied, 138 S. Ct. 740 (2018).
In the TCPA context, therefore, courts have examined whether plaintiffs were injured in some concrete way—for instance, because they were unable to use a phone line tied up by a telemarketing solicitation, Mey v. Got Warranty, 193 F. Supp. 3d 641, 645 (N.D. W. Va. 2016); because of “aggravation” caused by an intrusion on privacy, Van Patten v. Vertical Fitness Grp., 847 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir. 2017); or, as under the TCPA’s junk fax provisions, because they incurred actual costs, Florence Endocrine Clinic v. Arriva Med., 858 F.3d 1362, 1366 (11th Cir. 2017). Those inquiries make good sense; trees falling in

29

forests might make sounds, but a phone ringing in an empty house creates no injury.
Krakauer made no such showing here. The court acknowledged that members of the certified class “did not necessarily pick up or hear ringing every call at issue in this case.” JA__[Doc.218at4]. Yet the court found standing based on some past “risk of an injury to privacy.” JA__[Doc.218at4] (emphasis added). That was legal error. “Risk of injury” can sometimes establish standing when a plaintiff complains of threatened future harm. See Clapper v. Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 416 (2013) (requiring a non-speculative “risk” of injury that is “certainly impending”); O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 494 (1974) (“It must be alleged that the plaintiff has sustained or is immediately in danger of sustaining some direct injury.”). But when a plaintiff seeks relief for alleged past harm, the “risk” that such harm might have happened is irrelevant. It amounts to saying, “I could have been hurt (even though I wasn’t).” If the harm didn’t occur, there’s no injury. See generally Summers v. Earth Island Inst., 555 U.S. 488, 499 (2009) (“Standing ... is not an ingenious academic exercise in the conceivable

30

but requires a factual showing of perceptible harm.”). The court’s contrary rule would nullify the requirement of injury in fact.
B.	The district court erred by certifying the overbroad class, and doubly so by not requiring any mechanism to weed out uninjured plaintiffs.
1.	Certification was improper because the class definition is impermissibly overbroad.
A court cannot certify a class defined to include putative members who are categorically ineligible to recover. Supra 19-20; Messner, 669 F.3d at 824-25; see Walker v. Consol. Freightways, Inc., 930 F.2d 376, 382 (4th Cir. 1991) (class cannot be certified when it includes individuals who have no claim and “lack standing to sue”).
The district court did just that. By definition, a class that includes non-subscribers “impermissibly includes members who have no cause of action as a matter of law.” Walewski v. Zenimax Media, 502 F. App’x 857, 861 (11th Cir. 2012) (unpublished). And by certifying a class of everyone “associated with” a phone number, the court “defined [the class] in such a way” that it includes members who necessarily “suffered no injury and lack standing.” Denney, 443 F.3d at 264; see Halvorson, 718 F.3d at 778-79; Kohen v. Pac. Inv. Mgmt. Co., 571 F.3d 672, 677 (7th Cir. 2009) (improper to certify a class “if the definition is so broad

31

that it sweeps within it persons who could not have been injured by the defendant’s conduct”). The class must therefore be decertified and the judgment vacated.
2.	Alternatively, the class must be decertified because Krakauer identified no administratively feasible mechanism to limit recovery to proper plaintiffs.
Even when certification is not categorically impermissible because the class includes people who cannot have a claim, certification remains inappropriate unless a plaintiff “show[s] that [he] can prove, through common evidence, that all class members were in fact injured.” In re Rail Freight Fuel Surcharge Antitrust Litig., 725 F.3d 244, 252 (D.C. Cir. 2013). The plaintiff must identify a mechanism for excluding uninjured class members that is “administratively feasible” and “protective of defendants’ Seventh Amendment and due process rights.” In re Nexium Antitrust Litig., 777 F.3d 9, 19 (1st Cir. 2015). In short, it must be “administratively feasible for the court to determine whether a particular individual is a member.” EQT Prod. Co. v. Adair, 764 F.3d 347, 358 (4th Cir. 2014).
Krakauer didn’t even try to identify an administratively feasible, classwide mechanism to separate subscribers from non-subscribers, and

32

to limit the class to those suffering injury. All he sought to prove was that SSN called certain numbers, not that any apparent class member was the affected subscriber, much less received calls or somehow suffered harm. His case was built on internal SSN records of unknown provenance—specifically, lists of SSN’s sales leads, which therefore just reflected whom SSN wanted to call. He narrowed those lists to numbers on the Do Not Call Registry. Where the records listed no names, he cross-referenced numbers against records in commercial databases (like LexisNexis) that purport to match people with phone numbers. JA__[Doc.407at5]; supra 27.
But those databases can’t be an administratively feasible way to identify subscribers—for the simple reason that, as described above (at 27), they don’t identify subscribers. Each record could come from “thousands of [different] sources,” like credit card applications, utilities, or warranties. See JA__[Doc.48-2at5&n.2]. And certainly Krakauer had no mechanism to establish—much less on a classwide basis—that anyone was injured. These lists of people “associated with” phone numbers didn’t show who picked up the phone, who was home when the phone rang, or even that any given class member still lived at the

33

residence at the time of the call. Supra 27-28, 30. Krakauer never intended to prove any of this, let alone by an administratively feasible, classwide mechanism.
3.	The district court failed to limit the judgment to those who prove liability.
Finally, even when a class has been properly certified, there must be some “way to ensure that the jury’s damages award goes only to injured class members.” Tyson Foods, 136 S. Ct. at 1053 (Roberts, C.J., concurring); id. at 1050 (opinion for the Court) (the question “whether uninjured class members may recover is one of great importance”). But, just like at certification—where Krakauer failed to identify a mechanism for using common proof to limit recovery to proper plaintiffs—at trial Krakauer never actually showed who was a proper plaintiff. He never showed that any class member (other than himself) was a subscriber, answered a phone call, heard the phone ring, or was otherwise injured. And the jury made no such finding. JA__[Doc.293at4] (jury instructions).
Instead, the court instructed the jury that it could enter judgment if it found that “SSN made at least two solicitation calls to those numbers.” JA__[Doc.293at9] (emphasis added); JA__[Doc.293at10]

34

(“Dr. Krakauer does not have to prove here whether names or addresses match up with phone numbers.... Krakauer must prove ... that ... SSN called the number at least twice during any 12-month period.”). But showing two calls to a given phone number doesn’t weed out valid from invalid claims. Imagine two calls to the Doe household; John Doe (the subscriber) answered the first and Jane Doe (home from college) answered the second. The jury would have had no idea—all it would know is that two calls were made to a given number. But the instructions nonetheless authorized it to enter judgment for anyone associated with that phone number—regardless whether John, Jane, or au pair Paula Poe submitted the claim. And if John Doe moved midyear and Tim Toe subscribed to that number, the jury would have no way to assess who the subscriber was at the time the calls were received.
Having permitted Krakauer to proceed through trial without establishing that any absent class member was injured—or even received the calls—the court’s post-trial process allowed those individuals to receive thousands of dollars. The court began by purporting to resolve the identities of approximately 11,000 class

35

members based solely on the fact that Krakauer's records mentioned their name. JA [Doc.407at1]. But these were the same records that merely showed the names of individuals "associated with" phone numbers. Supra 27-28, 32-34. The court did not require these individuals to attest they were the subscriber or actually received the calls. JA [Doc.351at16, Doc.407at1, 3].
Worse still, Krakauer's records showed numerous phone numbers with disparate associated names. JA [Doc.335at18-19, Doc.390-lat4-10]. For instance:
For the phone number (303) 426-9957, the court awarded $21,600 to Chris Aguirre, even though LexisNexis shows Kelly Liddle associated with the number. JA [Doc.390-1at33].
For the phone number (704) 588-3794, the court awarded $7,200 to Noah Huggins Huggins (sic), even though LexisNexis shows James Bakker associated with the number. Moreover, Bakker is the individual associated with the number during the class period, while Huggins is associated with the number almost two years after the class period. JA [Doc.390-1at8]
The court refused to consider the conflicting evidence.
JA [Doc.407at2-3].
For the remaining approximately 7,000 class members, the court
did require a claim form. But that form asked only whether "you or
36

someone in your household ha[d] this telephone number” during the class period. JA__[Doc.361at3]. It did not ask the claimant to identify who in the household had the number, or who answered any call. See JA__[Doc.361at3]. It did not ask the claimant to state that the household had the number during the entire period, or even at the time the calls were made. It thereby allowed a claim from anyone who lived in a household with someone who had the phone number at some point during the class period.
The result: The court allowed the jury to find in favor of over 18,000 claimants—and award tens of millions of dollars—without finding that a single identifiable individual other than Krakauer was a telephone subscriber or had Article III standing. Although some absent class members presumably were subscribers during the class period, and could have been part of some properly constituted class, the class was not so limited, and the evidence didn’t show this. The judgment must be overturned.

37

II.	The Court Failed To Instruct The Jury To Determine
Whether Each Class Member Received Two Calls Within A Year.
Next, the judgment must be vacated because the court improperly instructed the jury. Under the TCPA, a plaintiff must prove she “received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period.” 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5). So there must be (1) a relevant “person” who
(2) “received more than one telephone call” (3) “within any 12-month period.” Charvat v. NMP, 656 F.3d 440, 449 (6th Cir. 2011) (describing this “threshold requirement”). In an individual action, a plaintiff might use a phone bill to show that she was the subscriber, and call records or testimony to show she received two calls within a year.
The court, however, instructed the jury very differently. Over DISH’s objection, the court “remove[d] from the ... trial any issues as to whether a particular phone number is associated with a particular person.” JA__[Doc.242at1]; see also JA__[Dec.12Tr.at79-80; Jan.17Tr.at160]. Thus, liability could be established if SSN merely called the same number twice, regardless of whether a single person received both calls. The court repeatedly told the jury that its “job is to decide ... whether SSN made at least two solicitation calls to those

38

numbers.” JA__[Doc.293at9] (emphasis added); see also JA__[Doc.293at10] (“Dr. Krakauer does not have to prove here whether names or addresses match up with phone numbers.... Krakauer must prove ... that ... SSN called the number at least twice during any 12-month period”); JA__[Doc.293at8].
The problem is simple: Two calls to the same number is not the same thing as two calls received by the same person. That’s because, among other reasons, phone numbers change hands. A call placed to a number in January wouldn’t be received by the same person as a call placed to that number in October if the original recipient moved or canceled their landline. And the problem is compounded by the court’s “associated with” class, which allows multiple people to submit claims for calls to a single number, without proof that an identified person received both calls. Supra 34-37.
This legally erroneous jury instruction, which the court reviews de novo, United States v. Mouzone, 687 F.3d 207, 217 (4th Cir. 2012), affected the verdict to a near certainty. Cf. BMG Rights Mgmt. (US) v. Cox Commc’ns, 881 F.3d 293, 305 (4th Cir. 2018) (vacatur requires “a reasonable probability that the erroneous instruction affected the jury’s

39

verdict”). Krakauer’s sole proof was a list of phone numbers that SSN had called. Supra 27 (discussing Five9 records). But Krakauer introduced no evidence and made no argument that the phone numbers didn’t change hands, or that any particular individual (apart from himself) received both calls. Supra 34-37. The verdict must therefore be reversed. See Palmetto State Med. Ctr. v. Operation Lifeline, 117 F.3d 142, 147 (4th Cir. 1997) (reversing judgments where the court issued erroneous instructions and “no evidence was presented” that could have supported liability).
III. No Reasonable Jury Could Find DISH Liable For The Calls Made By SSN.
The problems in this case aren’t just limited to the plaintiffs; the defendant is the wrong one too. Specifically, the verdict must be reversed because the court erroneously permitted the jury to hold DISH liable for SSN’s misdeeds. “[C]ommon sense is opposed to making one man pay for another man’s wrong.” Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., Agency, 5 Harv. L. Rev. 1, 14 (1891). That proposition is embodied in common-law principles of agency, and the court here “went well beyond [these] traditional principles” to find an agency relationship. Meyer v. Holley, 537 U.S. 280, 286, 290-91 (2003).

40

Because the facts concerning the relationship between DISH and SSN are not meaningfully in dispute, it is a “question of law” whether those facts gave rise to an agency relationship. Cilecek v. Inova Health Sys. Servs., 115 F.3d 256, 261 (4th Cir. 1997); see also Bocek v. JGA Assocs., 616 F. App’x 567, 576 (4th Cir. 2015) (unpublished) (“Whether those undisputed facts establish the agency relationship is a legal question for us to decide.”). As the court acknowledged, DISH could be vicariously liable for SSN’s calls only if Krakauer proved (1) that DISH authorized SSN to act as its agent, and (2) that SSN acted within the scope of that authority when it made calls violating the TCPA. JA__[Doc.341at4]. But the contracts between DISH and SSN expressly withheld actual authority, and DISH did not have the day-to-day control necessary to create agency. Infra § III.A. Moreover, even if SSN had been endowed with actual authority, SSN blatantly exceeded its scope when it violated DISH’s express instructions, including not to call Krakauer in particular. Infra § III.B.
A.	SSN was not DISH’s agent.
1. “Agency is the fiduciary relationship that arises when one
person (a ‘principal’) manifests assent to another person (an ‘agent’) that

41

the agent shall act on the principal’s behalf and subject to the principal’s control, and the agent manifests assent or otherwise consents so to act.” Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01 (emphasis added). The italicized provisions are critical. There must be assent: a clear, mutual agreement that the agent has authority to bind the principal. Gen. Bldg. Contractors Ass’n v. Pennsylvania, 458 U.S. 375, 393-94 (1982); see New Millennium Consulting v. United HealthCare Servs., 695 F.3d 854, 857, 859 (8th Cir. 2012) (no assent where parties’ agreement disclaimed agency); Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01 cmt. d; id. § 3.01. Assent may be express or implied, United States v. Ellis, 527 F.3d 203, 208 (1st Cir. 2008), but without it, there can be no agency.
A principal also must have the power to “control” the agent’s “day-to-day operations.” Carlisle v. Deere & Co., 576 F.3d 649, 656 (7th Cir. 2009); Hofherr v. Dart Indus., 853 F.2d 259, 262 (4th Cir. 1988).3 For the principal to be bound by the agent’s actions, it must have “the right
3 See also Williams v. United States, 50 F.3d 299, 306 (4th Cir. 1995) (United States must “supervise[] the ‘day-to-day operations’ of the endeavor” to create agency under the FTCA); Wynn’s Extended Care v. Bradley, 619 F. App’x 216, 219 (4th Cir. 2015) (unpublished) (no agency absent “power to control ... day-to-day operation”).

42

to control” those actions. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01 cmt. f. This requirement applies equally to the TCPA. E.g., Keating v. Peterson’s Nelnet, 2014 WL 1891369, at *5 (N.D. Ohio May 12, 2014) (TCPA plaintiff must show “that the defendant controlled or had the right to control [the caller] and the manner and means of the ... campaign they conducted”), aff’d, 615 F. App’x 365 (6th Cir. 2015); see Meyer, 537 U.S. at 285 (traditional agency-law principles apply to federal statutory torts).
2. Krakauer demonstrated neither assent nor control. Far from assenting to an agency relationship, the companies’ express understanding was that SSN—like the thousands of other companies authorized to market DISH’s services—was an independent contractor.
That understanding is reflected in the strongest evidence of the relationship between DISH and SSN: the “contract actually executed between the parties.” Logue v. United States, 412 U.S. 521, 530 (1973); Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.03 (manifestations of intent determine whether an agency relationship was formed). Such “formal written” instructions are “often dispositive,” Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.02 cmts. c, f, g, because an “agent has no authority to act

43

contrary to the known wishes and instructions of his principal,” Old Sec. Life Ins. Co. v. Cont’l Ill. Nat’l Bank and Tr. Co., 740 F.2d 1384, 1391 (7th Cir. 1984).
Here, the Retailer Agreements between DISH and SSN unambiguously and repeatedly made clear that SSN was acting, not as an agent, but “as an independent contractor.” JA__[JTX1at1]; accord JA__[JTX2at1; DX84at1]. Section 11 emphasizes that SSN is not, and may not claim to be, DISH’s agent:
INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. The relationship of the parties hereto is that of independent contractors. Retailer shall conduct its business as an independent contractor .... Retailer ... shall not, under any circumstances, hold itself out
to the public or represent that it is EchoStar[4] or an ... agent,
or sub-agent of EchoStar....
JA__[JTX1at21; JTX2at22; DX84at8].
DISH repeatedly confirmed this understanding. In 2006, for
instance, DISH reminded SSN that
[t]he Retailer Agreement clearly provides that your relationship with EchoStar is that of an independent contractor. Your outbound and inbound call agents MUST identify the company that they work for. AGENTS MAY NOT SAY THAT THEY WORK FOR DISH NETWORK.
4 DISH formerly was known as EchoStar.

44

JA__[DX2at2]; see JA__[DX3at47] (equally direct message in 2007).
That DISH and SSN “expended such considerable efforts to avoid an agency designation is palpable evidence that [they] did not intend to consent ... to an agency relationship.” CFTC v. Gibraltar Monetary Corp., 575 F.3d 1180, 1189 (11th Cir. 2009). The written understanding of contracting parties is powerful evidence of their relationship. E.g., Children’s Broad. Corp. v. Walt Disney Co., 245 F.3d 1008, 1022 (8th Cir. 2001) (decisive that parties “expressly disclaimed” agency relationship); NLRB v. Local Union 1058, 957 F.2d 149, 152-53 (4th Cir. 1992) (written constitution and bylaws show that “individuals clearly did not have the actual authority” to act as agents); Standard Acc. Ins. v. Simpson, 64 F.2d 583, 588 (4th Cir. 1933) (no actual authority where a “letter of instructions expressly forbade such action”); Integrated Consulting Servs. v. LDDS Commc’ns, 176 F.3d 475, 1999 WL 218740, at *4-6 (4th Cir. 1999) (unpublished) (parties’ conduct did not overcome an express written disclaimer of agency).
Krakauer presented no evidence at trial—no witness and no document—indicating that DISH or SSN read the contracts, despite their plain terms, as creating an agency relationship. On the contrary,

45

the testimony was entirely consistent with the express disclaimer of an agency relationship. See JA__[Jan.11Tr.at219-21, 229; Jan.12Tr.at128, 144; Jan.13Tr.at163]. And that made perfect sense. DISH and SSN had no reason to create a fiduciary relationship. DISH wanted SSN to market its services; SSN wanted to work with DISH; and neither needed an agency relationship to do that. They just needed to enter into an ordinary contract, like companies do all the time in the marketing context.
3. Notwithstanding the parties’ express agreement, the court thought other contractual provisions implicitly created the agency relationship that the same contracts explicitly rejected in Section 11. JA__[Doc.338at8], cited in JA__[Doc.341at5]. Those other provisions would have to be especially powerful to nullify the contracts’ express disavowals of agency; to interpret them as doing so would violate the “cardinal principle of contract construction: that a document should be read to give effect to all its provisions and to render them consistent with each other.” Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, 514 U.S. 52, 63 (1995). But, interpreting the contract de novo, see Sky Angel U.S. v. Discovery Commc’ns, 885 F.3d 271, 278 (4th Cir. 2018), there is no

46

indication that the parties intended to negate Section 11’s definition of their relationship. Instead, the provisions highlighted by the court merely authorize DISH to enforce performance standards and exercise quality control—provisions that are routine in independent contractor and franchisee relationships. E.g., Hoffnagle v. McDonald’s Corp., 522 N.W.2d 808, 810, 812-13 (Iowa 1994) (detailing McDonald’s extensive control over franchisees); see Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01 cmt. f.
The court pointed to Section 2.3, which requires SSN “to use its best efforts to continuously and actively advertise, promote and market Programming.” JA__[Doc.338at8] (citing JA__[JTX1at5]). But of course SSN had to use its best efforts to market DISH—that was the whole point of this contract. The court cited no support for the idea that requiring a party to perform its contractual obligations shows day-to-day control. Rather, the thing that “distinguishes ... [an] agency agreement from other agreements” is “the element of continuous subjection to the will of the principal.” Restatement (Second) of Agency § 1 cmt. b; Integrated Consulting Servs., 1999 WL 218740, at *5.

47

Nor did the parties negate their express disavowal of agency by means of the statement buried in Paragraph 7.4 that any “records created or maintained by, or on behalf of, EchoStar relating to any DISH Network Subscriber” belong to DISH. JA__[JTX1at17], cited at JA__[Doc.338at8]. It stands to reason that DISH would own the records concerning its subscribers and SSN would control the records regarding its prospects. Nothing about such an arrangement establishes assent to an agency relationship, much less operational control.
Finally, the court relied on a single sentence that it thought “gave Dish nearly unlimited power to impose additional requirements on SSN.” JA__[Doc.338at9], cited at JA__[Doc.341at5]. That sentence, however, says nothing about agency. It is buried in the middle of a section about how retailers take orders, in a subsection governing DISH’s promotional offers. Specifically, Section 7.3 requires retailers to follow DISH’s pricing and terms for promotional programming. JA__[JTX1at17]. Retailers must make accurate disclosures to customers, i.e., “disclose to each prospective DISH [customer] the relevant terms of ... each Promotional Program.” JA__[JTX1at17]. In

48

that context, Section 7.3 states that Retailers must “comply with all” rules “applicable to any Promotional Program” and “take all actions and refrain from taking any action, as requested by [DISH] in connection with the marketing, advertisement, promotion and/or solicitation of orders.” JA__[Doc.338at8] (quoting JA__[JTX1at17]).
Thus, Section 7.3 does not broadly confer “unlimited power”; it means that retailers cannot promise customers promotional packages, prices, or terms that DISH does not offer (e.g., “$1 HBO!”). JA__[JTX1at17]. And if DISH directs the retailer to stop making an offer, or to correct erroneous advertising, the retailer must comply. JA__[JTX1at17]. That understanding was confirmed by uncontroverted testimony. JA__[Jan.11Tr.at118-19, 222-23].
The district court’s interpretation of Section 7.3 nullifies Section 11’s express statement about agency, contrary to ordinary rules of contract interpretation, based on a single misinterpreted sentence buried on page 17 of a 37-page agreement. JA__[JTX1at17]. It also flouts the contract’s clear direction that Section 11 applies “[n]otwithstanding anything ... in this Agreement to the contrary.” JA__[JTX1at21]. Instead, Section 7.3 shows at most that DISH

49

“specif[ied] standards” for SSN to follow, Logue, 412 U.S. at 529-30, and “demand[ed] compliance with” them, Williams, 50 F.3d at 306. Such quality control is legally insufficient to show the day-to-day control necessary for agency. Id.; Restatement (Third) of Agency § 1.01 cmt. f; see also Thomas v. Freeway Foods, 406 F. Supp. 2d 610, 617 (M.D.N.C. 2005) (mere fact that a franchisor was contractually allowed to visit and inspect franchisees did not create agency).
4. Elsewhere, the court indicated that the parties’ conduct established agency. Given the parties’ express contractual understanding, any implied agency relationship could be established only through “clear and convincing evidence.” Simpson, 64 F.2d at 588; see also Leon v. Caterpillar Indus., 69 F.3d 1326, 1336 (7th Cir. 1995) (where “language in [a contract] ... expressly disavows an agency relationship,” evidence of the parties’ conduct “falls short” unless it provides an especially powerful indication of a contrary intent). The court identified nothing of the kind.
The evidence was clear that DISH didn’t want “to control the day-to-day activities of SSN”; doing so “wasn’t practical.” JA__[Jan.12Tr.at144-45]. Indeed, given the sheer number of

50

independent retailers around the country—some 3,500 in all—such control was out of the question. JA__[Jan.11Tr.at54, 228-29; Jan.12Tr.at92; Jan.13Tr.at161-64]. So DISH hired SSN as an independent contractor that made its own hiring decisions, paid its own employees, set hours and terms of employment, and obtained its own office space, telephone lines, and equipment. JA__[Jan.11Tr.at217-19, 227-29; Jan.12Tr.at148; TehranchiDep.Tr.at92-93].
Notably, the court itself found that “Dish did not own SSN or direct its day-to-day operations.” JA__[Doc.338at7] (citing trial testimony). The court was right. Uncontroverted testimony established that SSN, not DISH, determined what phone numbers SSN would call, and indeed whether SSN would engage in telemarketing at all. JA__[Jan.11Tr.at217-18, 226-27; Jan.12Tr.at148; Jan.13Tr.at162; TehranchiDep.Tr.at92-93]. DISH’s Senior Vice President in charge of indirect sales explained that DISH did not “ha[ve] the right to control SSN’s sales pitch.” JA__[Jan.11Tr.at225-27]. And DISH’s compliance manager elaborated that SSN’s marketing strategies were proprietary and SSN “didn’t want anyone to have information about ... their actual sales script and ... how they were selling.” JA__[Jan.12Tr.at144-46].

51

DISH did not even require exclusivity; SSN at one time marketed DISH’s biggest competitor, DirecTV. JA__[JTX3at2; Jan.11Tr.at219; Jan.13Tr.at158-159; TehranchiDep.Tr.at17-18, 72-73]. Compare Leon, 69 F.3d at 1336 (“[T]hat Calumet could sell Caterpillar’s competitors’ equipment is further evidence that Calumet was not acting principally for Caterpillar’s benefit, but rather as an independent sales representative, to make a profit.”).
Notwithstanding these undisputed facts, the court thought the parties’ conduct established agency. It cited evidence that DISH imposed certain performance requirements on SSN—for instance, by requiring SSN to comply with telemarketing laws and scrub its call lists with PossibleNow (a company specializing in TCPA compliance) to ensure they contained no numbers on the Registry. JA__[Doc.341at5]. But, just like imposing quality-control standards, supra 49-50,
requiring compliance with government laws and regulations does not create an agency relationship. See FedEx Home Delivery v. NLRB, 563 F.3d 492, 501 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (performance requirements based on efforts to comply with government regulation do not support agency because the “company is not controlling the [contractor], the law is”). It

52

would be the height of irony—and very bad policy—to hold DISH liable because it told SSN not to violate the TCPA.
The court also pointed to a 2009 Assurance of Voluntary Compliance (AVC) between DISH and state attorneys general. The AVC focused on DISH’s own obligations regarding various consumer issues, and DISH agreed to monitor and discipline retailers for telemarketing violations. JA__[Doc.341at5]. The court found this to be evidence of DISH’s ability to control SSN’s day-to-day marketing operations. JA__[Doc.341at5] (citing JA__[Doc.338at14-15]). But the AVC expressly recognizes that retailers like SSN are “independent.” JA__[PX55at8]. Moreover, a third-party covenant to look for contractor violations does not establish the control that is necessary for an agency relationship. Supra 50-52. Holding otherwise would profoundly change settled business expectations and expose countless companies to liability for engaging in routine compliance practices. Including this commonplace requirement did not convert an independent contractor into an agent.

53

B.	Even if SSN were DISH’s agent, it exceeded its authority when it made these calls.
Even when agency exists, a principal is liable only for acts within the scope of the agent’s authority. Meyer, 537 U.S. at 285; United States v. Hilton, 701 F.3d 959, 970 (4th Cir. 2012); Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.02. Unlawful acts are almost never within the scope of an agent’s authority, except in the rare situation where the principal issued clear instructions to break the law. Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.02 cmt. h; see also id. § 2.02 cmt. c (scope of an agent’s authority must be based on “the principal’s manifestations to the agent”). Here, DISH expressly limited SSN’s authority by instructing it not to call numbers on the Registry. And it unambiguously instructed SSN not to call Krakauer himself. SSN acted outside the scope of any authority by disregarding those instructions.
1. The district court concluded that SSN acted within the scope of its authority because DISH “consent[ed] or acquiesce[d]” to the conduct. JA__[Doc.341at6-7]. On the contrary, DISH repeatedly and unequivocally instructed SSN to follow the law:
Retailer shall comply with all applicable governmental statutes, laws, rules, regulations, ordinances, codes,

54

directives, and orders ..., and Retailer is solely responsible for its compliance ....
JA__[JTX1at18; JTX2at18]. Such contractual provisions are common and essential; it is near-impossible to scrutinize every action taken by a nationwide network of independent contractors.
More specifically, retailers were told to comply with telemarketing laws. DISH repeatedly stressed that it does “not tolerate or condone marketing activities that fail to comply with ... applicable state and federal laws.” JA__[DX2at1] (“Facts Blast”); see JA__[DX1at7] (same), __[DX3at47] (script for chat with retailers), __[PX15atDISH-Paper-007988] (email to SSN), __[Jan.13Tr.at170-72, 174] (testimony). More specific still, DISH required retailers to “[c]omply with all applicable state and federal ‘Do Not Call’ laws, including, but not limited to ... the Telephone Consumer Protection Act.” JA__[DX2at1].
If those directions left any doubts, they should have been resolved when DISH told SSN not to call Krakauer. This is particularly critical because, as the court instructed the jury, if Krakauer “fails to establish any essential part of his claim by a preponderance of the evidence, then you should find against him and the class ....” JA__[Doc.293at2]. And the evidence was unrefuted that SSN acted outside the scope of any

55

authority when it called Krakauer. When SSN first called Krakauer to market DISH services, Krakauer complained to DISH. Supra 8. DISH instructed SSN to “immediately insure that this phone number has been added to your internal [Do Not Call] Registry.” JA__[DX9; Jan.12Tr.at107-09]. SSN assured DISH that it had addressed the issue, removed Krakauer’s phone number from its list of numbers to be called, and added Krakauer’s phone number to its internal Do Not Call list. JA__[DX8at1-2; Jan.12Tr.at110-12]; supra 8-9.
In the face of this evidence, no reasonable jury could conclude that SSN believed it had authority to call Krakauer. Simpson, 64 F.2d at 588 (agent exceeded his authority when the principal “expressly forbade” the conduct); see Restatement (Third) of Agency § 2.02 cmt. g (“[A]n agent’s actual authority extends only to acts that the agent reasonably believes the principal has authorized or wishes the agent to perform.”). And even if DISH’s instructions about Krakauer weren’t dispositive, SSN’s disregard of DISH’s other, repeated instructions to comply with the law, including telemarketing laws, should have been. When an agent “expressly contradict[s]” the principal’s “actual instructions, this is clearly not express ... agency.” Bridgeview Health

56

Care Ctr. v. Clark, 816 F.3d 935, 939 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 200 (2016).
Bridgeview is closely analogous. In that case, the defendant contracted with a marketer to send “about 100 faxes to local businesses within a 20-mile radius” of a town. Instead, the marketer sent nearly 5,000 faxes across three states in violation of the TCPA. Id. at 937. The Seventh Circuit held that the defendant could not be held liable for faxes sent outside the scope of the defendant’s authorization. Id. at 938-39. The result here follows a fortiori: Not only did DISH not authorize the calls here, it forbade them. A contract between a company and its marketer “prohibiting telemarketing methods that would violate state or federal law” “preclude[s]” liability. Jones v. Royal Admin. Servs., 887 F.3d 443, 446 (9th Cir. 2018).
2. In ruling otherwise, the court attributed to the jury the conclusion that, by failing to adequately monitor SSN’s telemarketing compliance, DISH implicitly overruled its express instruction that SSN did have to comply with the law. JA__[Doc.341at7-10]. This unlikely theory fails as a matter of law. Neither Krakauer nor the court cited any authority holding that a principal’s mere failure to supervise

57

creates actual authority for an agent to act. That would be a particularly strange rule where legal violations are concerned. As discussed above (at 54), authority to violate the law is rare and it must be clearly expressed. It would have to be especially clearly expressed here, given that DISH specifically said not to violate the law. A mere failure to supervise can’t possibly do that work.
Furthermore, no witness testified and no document showed that DISH’s repeated instructions not to violate the TCPA were “empty words” that SSN interpreted as meaning the opposite. JA__[Doc.338at23] (willfulness order). No employee or officer of SSN or DISH testified that SSN believed it could ignore DISH’s instructions. Krakauer presented no document saying so. Simply put, there is no evidence that DISH wanted SSN to act in the unlawful fashion it did. To conclude otherwise would eviscerate the requirement that an agent must act within the scope of its authority.
IV.	The Treble-Damages Award Must Be Overturned. Finally, the treble damages cannot stand.
The reason the court trebled damages is clear: It thought DISH should have done more to monitor SSN, including by hiring an outside

58

auditor. JA__[Doc.338at1, 18]. But everyone always can do more. That’s why, even for mere negligence, there must be a legal duty to act. Restatement (Second) of Torts § 284; Spaulding v. Wells Fargo Bank, 714 F.3d 769, 780 (4th Cir. 2013). The court identified no such duty, and even if it had, treble damages aren’t available for negligence; the TCPA authorizes them only when “the defendant willfully or knowingly” disregarded the statute. 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5)(C). A plaintiff must show the defendant knew it “was performing the conduct that violates the statute,” Lary v. Trinity Physician Fin. & Ins. Servs., 780 F.3d 1101, 1107 (11th Cir. 2015) (TCPA case), or assumed “a risk of violating the law substantially greater than the risk associated with ... mere[] careless[ness],” Safeco, 551 U.S. at 69 (articulating willfulness standard).
The court did not apply this standard. JA__[Doc.338at21, 27 n.17]. Instead, it imputed SSN’s supposed willfulness and knowledge to DISH, and determined that DISH “should have known” about SSN’s conduct—that is, that DISH was negligent in failing to “investigate and monitor” SSN more closely. In both respects, the court erred as a matter of law. Infra § IV.A. And under the proper standard, DISH’s

59

conduct was not willful or knowing. Infra § IV.B. Accordingly, damages must be reduced to the $400-per-call awarded by the jury; or, at a minimum, the case must be remanded for application of the proper legal standard.
A.	The damages must be vacated because the district court made two legal errors in applying the willful-or-knowing standard.
1.	The court applied the wrong legal standard when it imputed SSN’s conduct to DISH.
The district court concluded that “SSN willfully and knowingly violated the provisions of the TCPA,” and that SSN’s conduct could be “imputed to DISH.” JA__[Doc.338at21]. It applied what it called the “traditional rule” that “a principal is liable for the willful acts of his agent.” JA__[Doc.338at22].
On the contrary, the rule has been something else for at least two centuries. If a principal neither “directed [its agent’s conduct], nor countenanced it, nor participated in it,” the principal may be “bound to repair all the real injuries”—that is, pay compensatory damages—but the principal is not liable for “vindictive damages.” The Amiable Nancy, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat) 546, 558-59 (1818); accord Kolstad v. Am. Dental Ass’n, 527 U.S. 526, 544 (1999). Rather, a principal is liable for

60

enhanced damages based on the agent’s conduct only when the principal engages in “reckless disregard of federally protected rights.” Kolstad, 527 U.S. at 544. The principal’s own conduct must reflect this heightened responsibility.
The two sources cited by the district court (at JA__[Doc.338at22]) do not hold otherwise. The first is a passing statement by the Oklahoma Supreme Court that “a principal ... is generally held liable for the willful acts of an agent” under Oklahoma law. Bosh v. Cherokee Cty. Bldg. Auth., 305 P.3d 994, 998 (Okla. 2013). That court simply acknowledged that a principal can be liable for an agent’s conduct “even though the servant or agent ... willfully or maliciously committed the wrongs,” id. at 998 n.14—i.e., that an agent’s willfulness doesn’t necessarily foreclose the principal’s liability. The other citation, Restatement (Third) of Agency § 7.04, merely states that a principal is generally liable for conduct by an agent within the scope of its
authority. Neither source purports to establish rules concerning vicarious liability for enhanced damages.

61

2.	The court applied a legally incorrect standard for willful conduct.
The court held in the alternative that DISH itself acted willfully. JA__[Doc.338at21]. In doing so, it applied a legally incorrect standard.
Willfulness is not to be found “in a typical ... case,” but only in rare cases involving “egregious ... behavior.” Halo Elecs. v. Pulse Elecs., 136 S. Ct. 1923, 1932 (2016). Thus, to “willfully” violate federal law, one must act “recklessly”: with an “unjustifiably high risk of” violating the statute. Safeco, 551 U.S. at 57-58, 68; see McLaughlin v. Richland Shoe Co., 486 U.S. 128, 132-33 (1988); TWA v. Thurston, 469 U.S. 111, 125-26 (1985). “[A] reckless defendant is one who ... knows of a substantial and unjustified risk of such wrongdoing” and acts nonetheless. Global-Tech Appliances v. SEB S.A., 563 U.S. 754, 770 (2011); RSM v. Herbert, 466 F.3d 316, 321-22 (4th Cir. 2006).5

5 The standard for “knowing” conduct is equally high, requiring actual knowledge of the circumstances giving rise to liability. RSM, 466 F.3d at 320-22. “[T]he violator [must] know he was performing the conduct that violates the statute.” Lary, 780 F.3d at 1107. It is not enough “that the violator knew he was making a call.” Id. Although the court asserted in passing that DISH acted “willfully and knowingly,” JA__[Doc.338at21], it did not analyze the question of knowing conduct or make the requisite findings, JA__[Doc.338at23-28].

62

Willfulness thus requires more than mere “careless[ness]” or “negligence.” Safeco, 551 U.S. at 68-69. Indeed, it requires a “substantially greater” showing than negligence, id. at 69 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 500)—so much greater that it amounts “to a difference in kind,” Mosser v. Fruehauf Corp., 940 F.2d 77, 85 (4th Cir. 1991) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts § 500 cmt. g). This heightened standard preserves “the statute’s distinction between violations that do not require an intent, and those willful[] and knowing violations that [C]ongress intended to punish more severely.” Lary, 780 F.3d at 1107.
The district court applied a substantially lower, legally incorrect standard. In assessing willfulness, it asked whether DISH “ha[d] reason to know, or should have known, that [SSN’s] conduct would violate the statute.” JA__[Doc.338at21] (emphasis added). But “know or should have known” is the standard for negligence, not willfulness. See BMG Rights Mgmt., 881 F.3d at 308; Coston v. Plitt Theatres, 831 F.2d 1321, 1338 (7th Cir. 1987) (Manion, J., concurring) (collecting cases rejecting “knew or should have known” for willfulness), vacated on other grounds, 486 U.S. 1020 (1988).

63

The court didn’t just use the terminology of negligence; it used the concepts too. Over and over, the court castigated DISH for failing to adequately “monitor” and “investigate” SSN. E.g., JA__[Doc.338at1, 6, 12, 23, 24, 26, 28]; see also JA__[Doc.370at22 n.22]. And it purported to balance the cost of monitoring with the likelihood of discovering violations. JA__[Doc.338at28]. But the reasonableness of preventative actions “bear[s] primarily on the question of negligence.” Mosser, 940 F.2d at 86. There could be no negligence (leave aside willfulness) unless the TCPA imposed a duty of care on DISH, and the court identified no such duty.
Instead, the court focused on DISH’s supposed failures under the AVC, the 2009 voluntary agreement between DISH and 46 state attorneys general. Supra 53. DISH, the court said, “did not take seriously the promises it made” in the AVC. JA__[Doc.338at29]. Over and over the court came back to this document and DISH’s supposed breaches. JA__[Doc.338at14-16, 29]. But, among the other problems with relying on this agreement (infra 73-74), the AVC creates no obligations under the TCPA. Rather, the AVC is a private agreement that, by its terms, confers no “rights or remedies” “upon any person”

64

and “may not be enforced by any person, entity, or sovereign except the Attorneys General.” JA__[PX55§7.2]. The agreement could not and did not create a TCPA duty, or a new willfulness standard, applicable solely to DISH.
B.	The damages must be reversed because DISH did not
willfully violate the TCPA as a matter of law.
Alternatively, the enhanced damages should be reversed outright because DISH’s conduct was not willful or knowing as a matter of law. See Humphrey v. Humphrey, 434 F.3d 243, 248 (4th Cir. 2006) (“court need not remand a case if the record permits only one resolution”).
This is because DISH had an “objectively reasonable” basis to believe it was complying with the TCPA. Safeco, 551 U.S. at 70 n.20. At the time of the calls, no court had imposed TCPA liability on an entity that did not initiate calls, based on the conduct of its agent. Moreover, it was reasonable to believe that SSN was not DISH’s agent. Infra § IV.B.1. And even if DISH was unreasonable in that belief, it was not “obvious” to DISH that SSN presented a “substantial[]” and “unjustifiabl[e] ... risk” of placing tens of thousands of unlawful Registry calls during the class period, Safeco, 551 U.S. at 68-69,

65

especially given DISH’s explicit instructions. Infra § IV.B.2. The treble damages therefore must be reversed.
1.	DISH reasonably believed, based on its contracts with SSN and compliance measures, that it had satisfied its legal obligations.
Conduct is not willful or knowing if it is based on an “erroneous, [but] not objectively unreasonable” understanding of the law. Safeco, 551 U.S. at 69; see id. at 70 n.20. Thus, in Safeco the Supreme Court held that an analogous willfulness requirement was not satisfied where the defendant’s errant belief in the lawfulness of its conduct was “not reckless.” Id. at 70-71; accord RCA/Ariola Int’l v. Thomas & Grayston Co., 845 F.2d 773, 779-80 (8th Cir. 1988) (manufacturer’s reasonable belief that it would not be held vicariously liable foreclosed willfulness). Here, similarly, even if DISH could be held liable for calls made by SSN (which it could not, supra 40-58), at a minimum DISH could reasonably believe otherwise.
Before the end of the class period, no court had held that an entity (like DISH) that neither placed violative calls nor directed an agent to call specific people could be held liable. And the TCPA supplied no clear answer. That is why the Sixth Circuit referred the question to the FCC.

66

Charvat v. EchoStar Satellite, LLC, 630 F.3d 459, 465-66 (6th Cir. 2010). The FCC itself then struggled with the question. It reasoned that the TCPA’s plain text indicates that “a seller” (here, DISH) “is not directly liable for a violation of the TCPA unless it initiates a call” itself. 28 FCC Rcd. 6574, 6582 (2013) (emphasis added). But it nonetheless “construed [the TCPA] to incorporate federal common law agency principles” “for TCPA violations committed by third-party telemarketers.” Id. at 6584.
That 2013 decision—two years after the class period—was the first time a court or agency held that a seller like DISH could be liable under the TCPA for calls it did not place. Thus, because “the statutory text and relevant court and agency guidance allow[ed] for more than one reasonable interpretation,” DISH cannot be a “knowing or reckless violator.” Safeco, 551 U.S. at 70 n.20; see Murray v. New Cingular Wireless Servs., 523 F.3d 719, 726 (7th Cir. 2008).
Moreover, even under the agency standard since articulated by the FCC, DISH would not have been “objectively unreasonable” in concluding, during the class period, that SSN was not its agent. The contracts between DISH and SSN stated explicitly that there was no

67

agency relationship. Supra 6, 44-45. No witness testified and no document suggested that DISH or SSN understood themselves to be in a principal-agent relationship. Supra 45-46, 50-51. DISH surely was reasonable in believing that SSN would not act outside the scope of any authority by disregarding DISH’s express directions not to call people on the Registry. Supra 54-58. And courts had rejected agency arguments about other DISH retailers. E.g., Charvat v. EchoStar Satellite, LLC, 676 F. Supp. 2d 668, 678-79 (S.D. Ohio 2009), vacated, 535 F. App’x 513 (6th Cir. 2013). It was objectively reasonable to believe that SSN was not DISH’s agent.
2.	DISH did not disregard a substantial risk that SSN was placing tens of thousands of Registry calls in 2010 and 2011.
a. DISH also did not act willfully because on no view of the evidence did it knowingly disregard a substantial risk that SSN was violating the TCPA on a widespread basis. That is what the district court would have to have found. In individual actions, each plaintiff would have to prove DISH acted willfully with respect to each individual violation. 47 U.S.C. § 227(c)(5)(C); Levy v. Receivables Performance Mgmt., 972 F. Supp. 2d 409, 425 (E.D.N.Y. 2013) (“[T]reble

68

damages are assessed based on each individual violation.”). The class-action device did not relieve them of that burden. See, e.g., Deposit Guar. Nat’l Bank v. Roper, 445 U.S. 326, 332 (1980) (class action “is a procedural right only”).
At issue here is the class period from May 2010 to August 2011. There is no evidence DISH knew SSN was engaged in widespread TCPA violations during this period. SSN placed over 1.6 million calls selling DISH services during that time, and DISH didn’t receive a single complaint from an SSN call recipient. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at138]; supra 910.
That indicated to DISH that SSN presented little risk of TCPA violations, let alone a “high risk” of widespread violations. Safeco, 551 U.S. at 68. As noted above (at 7), DISH’s head of third-party
compliance gave uncontroverted testimony that violations correlate with complaints: One would expect a “staggering number” of complaints if a retailer took no precautions to avoid calling people on the Do Not Call Registry, yet DISH received none during the class period. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at114-15].

69

b. With no complaints about calls made during the class period, Krakauer had to prove willfulness some other way. He pointed to a handful of complaints about SSN that DISH received prior to the class period. JA__[Doc.338at10-12]. The court concluded that DISH’s decision to continue contracting with SSN after these complaints, and “not take any action to monitor or oversee SSN,” showed willful participation by DISH in SSN’s violations during the class period. JA__[Doc.338at12, 24].
The mere fact that DISH knew of a few earlier complaints doesn’t establish DISH acted willfully during the relevant time. Indeed, prior violations, without more, don’t demonstrate willfulness even when the defendant itself engaged in the prior conduct. Levy, 972 F. Supp. 2d at 425 (“[T]he fact that [the defendant] has been found to have violated the TCPA in other instances does not suggest, as a matter of law, that they acted knowingly and willfully.”); McCaskill v. Navient Sols., 178 F. Supp. 3d 1281, 1294-95 (M.D. Fla. 2016) (same).
If those prior complaints were relevant at all, it would only be to show whether DISH was reckless in concluding (during the class period) that SSN posed no risk of widespread TCPA violations. See Safeco, 551

70

U.S. at 69. But the evidence is clear. It was reasonable (and at worst, negligent) to believe SSN posed no such risk. Following complaints about SSN placing pre-recorded calls in 2004 (years before the class period), JA__[Doc.338at10-11], and lawsuits against SSN in that period under state Do Not Call statutes,6 DISH repeatedly admonished SSN to comply with the law—and the pre-recorded call violations stopped. See JA__[PX120at4; PX504at1; PX607at1]; JA__[Doc.338at24] (finding calls stopped). In 2006, moreover, SSN changed its management. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at98]. And in 2008, SSN contracted with PossibleNow—the industry leader in telemarketing-compliance services—to scrub its call lists. JA__[DX6at1; Jan.12Tr.at90-91, 106].
As a result, from the time of the 2006 management change through the end of the class period in 2011, DISH received only five Registry-related complaints from SSN call recipients. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at87]; supra 7. Measured “against a background of
6 JA__[Jan.11Tr.at14; Jan.12Tr.at98, 133-34]. SSN settled the North Carolina suit with no admission of wrongdoing, and the Florida suit resulted in an injunction requiring SSN to comply with the law. JA__[PX186at1-2] (North Carolina); JA__[PX191] (Florida). Neither suit involved calls marketing DISH services.

71

millions of calls,” this raised no “red flag for” SSN.
JA__[Jan.12Tr.at86]; see also JA__[Jan.12Tr.at101, 133, 144]. The district court thought it unreasonable for DISH to rely on complaints as the barometer of TCPA compliance. JA__[Doc.338at25-26&n.15]. But again, “reasonableness” wasn’t the standard; that denotes negligence. Supra 62-64. And DISH’s conclusion was not reckless: “[E]ven a few[] inadvertent errors ... may not amount to ‘willful’ failures, even when the legal requirement ... was known.” RSM, 466 F.3d at 322. That holds especially true for the TCPA; perfect TCPA compliance is nearly impossible. JA__[Jan.12Tr.at101-02; Jan.13Tr.at36]. In short, DISH reasonably believed that SSN had “righted [its] wrongs.” JA__[PX15at7995; Jan.12Tr.at133-34].
c. Nor, contrary to the district court’s conclusion, did complaints from Krakauer or a Mr. Campbell about pre-class-period calls alert DISH that “SSN was not scrubbing its customer lists” against the Registry during the class period. JA__[Doc.338at18, 23, 26]. The court believed these facts established willfulness because, in its view, a telemarketer who uses unscrubbed lists knows it will call people on the Registry. Id.

72

Both the premise and the conclusion are mistaken. When DISH investigated, SSN provided a reasonable explanation: Krakauer and Campbell had been SSN customers, and so fell within a TCPA exception for established business relationships. See JA__[PX15atDISH-Paper-007980-81; PX899at2]. This therefore indicated no widespread problem with scrubbing, because there is no obligation to scrub established business relationships against the Registry. Supra 8-9. DISH also did not leave it at that. DISH “caution[ed]” SSN to seek “legal counsel” to confirm its understanding of the established business relationship exception. JA__[PX899at1]. SSN promised it would never call either person again. JA__[PX15atDISH-Paper-007980; PX899at2]. And DISH received no further complaints from people with whom SSN said it had established business relationships.
d. Last, the court believed DISH was blameworthy because it “did not take seriously the promises it made” in the AVC. JA__[Doc.338at29]. We explain above (at 64-65) why that was legal error. Furthermore, using the TCPA to punish DISH’s supposed noncompliance with the AVC violates due process. “Due process does not permit courts, in the calculation of punitive damages, to adjudicate the

73

merits of other parties’ hypothetical claims against a defendant under the guise of the reprehensibility analysis ....” State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 420, 423 (2003).
That’s especially true because the court itself admitted the AVC, over DISH’s strenuous Rule 403 objection, for one limited purpose: assessing agency. JA__[Jan.6Hr’gTr.at22]. The court therefore erred when it used the document to assess willfulness. United States v. Poole, 640 F.3d 114, 118 (4th Cir. 2011) (court erred when it “apparently gave some consideration to matters that were not in evidence in the case”). Had DISH known that compliance with the agreement would be used to assess willfulness, it would have responded with evidence establishing its compliance.7 For instance, DISH would have shown—as the federal court in Illinois found—that DISH made “real changes ... in late 2008 and 2009” when it “fired numerous Retailers, cut the number of Order Entry Retailers, and instituted changes in the Quality Assurance
7 The court mischaracterized DISH’s co-founder as having said that the AVC “did not change DISH’s procedures at all.” JA__[Doc.338at29-30]. The testimony was that DISH disciplined retailers both before and after the AVC. JA__[Jan.13Tr.at168-69].

74

program.” JA__[Doc.347-01at462]; see also JA__[Doc.347-01at105-06].
Because the finding of willfulness fails as a matter of law, the treble damages must be reversed.
CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the judgment should be reversed; in the
alternative, vacated; and at a minimum, the treble-damages award
must be vacated or reversed.

(iii) the notice sets forth the requirements for a request under subparagraph (E);
(iv) the notice includes—
a domestic contact telephone and facsimile machine number for the recipient to transmit such a request to the sender; and
a cost-free mechanism for a recipient to transmit a request pursuant to such notice to the sender of the unsolicited advertisement; the Commission shall by rule require the sender to provide such a mechanism and may, in the discretion of the Commission and subject to such conditions as the Commission may prescribe, exempt certain classes of small business senders, but only if the Commission determines that the costs to such class are unduly burdensome given the revenues generated by such small businesses;

by regulation issued after public notice and opportunity for public comment; and
if the Commission determines that such notice required by paragraph (1)(C)(iii) is not necessary to protect the ability of the members of such associations to stop such associations from sending any future unsolicited advertisements;
(G)(i) may, consistent with clause (ii), limit the duration of the existence of an established business relationship, however, before establishing any such limits, the Commission shall—

ADD7

determine whether the existence of the exception under paragraph (1)(C) relating to an established business relationship has resulted in a significant number of complaints to the Commission regarding the sending of unsolicited advertisements to telephone facsimile machines;
determine whether a significant number of any such complaints involve unsolicited advertisements that were sent on the basis of an established business relationship that was longer in duration than the Commission believes is consistent with the reasonable expectations of consumers;
evaluate the costs to senders of demonstrating the existence of an established business relationship within a specified period of time and the benefits to recipients of establishing a limitation on such established business relationship; and
determine whether with respect to small businesses, the costs would not be unduly burdensome; and
(ii) may not commence a proceeding to determine whether to limit the duration of the existence of an established business relationship before the expiration of the 3-month period that begins on July 9, 2005; and

(c) Protection of subscriber privacy rights
(1) Rulemaking proceeding required
Within 120 days after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall initiate a rulemaking proceeding concerning the need to protect residential telephone subscribers' privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object. The proceeding shall—
(A) compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures (including the use of electronic databases, telephone network technologies, special directory markings, industry-based or company-specific “do not call” systems, and any other alternatives, individually or in combination) for their effectiveness in protecting such privacy rights, and in terms of their cost and other advantages and disadvantages;

ADD9

evaluate the categories of public and private entities that would have the capacity to establish and administer such methods and procedures;
consider whether different methods and procedures may apply for local telephone solicitations, such as local telephone solicitations of small businesses or holders of second class mail permits;
consider whether there is a need for additional Commission authority to further restrict telephone solicitations, including those calls exempted under subsection (a)(3) of this section, and, if such a finding is made and supported by the record, propose specific restrictions to the Congress; and
develop proposed regulations to implement the methods and procedures that the Commission determines are most effective and efficient to accomplish the purposes of this section.
Regulations
Not later than 9 months after December 20, 1991, the Commission shall conclude the rulemaking proceeding initiated under paragraph (1) and shall prescribe regulations to implement methods and procedures for protecting the privacy rights described in such paragraph in an efficient, effective, and economic manner and without the imposition of any additional charge to telephone subscribers.
Use of database permitted
The regulations required by paragraph (2) may require the establishment and operation of a single national database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that compiled list and

ADD10

parts thereof available for purchase. If the Commission determines to require such a database, such regulations shall—
specify a method by which the Commission will select an entity to administer such database;
require each common carrier providing telephone exchange service, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commission, to inform subscribers for telephone exchange service of the opportunity to provide notification, in accordance with regulations established under this paragraph, that such subscriber objects to receiving telephone solicitations;
specify the methods by which each telephone subscriber shall be informed, by the common carrier that provides local exchange service to that subscriber, of (i) the subscriber's right to give or revoke a notification of an objection under subparagraph (A), and (ii) the methods by which such right may be exercised by the subscriber;
specify the methods by which such objections shall be collected and added to the database;
prohibit any residential subscriber from being charged for giving or revoking such notification or for being included in a database compiled under this section;
prohibit any person from making or transmitting a telephone solicitation to the telephone number of any subscriber included in such database;
specify (i) the methods by which any person desiring to make or transmit telephone solicitations will obtain access to the database, by area code or local exchange prefix, as required to avoid calling the telephone numbers of subscribers included in

ADD11

such database; and (ii) the costs to be recovered from such persons;
specify the methods for recovering, from persons accessing such database, the costs involved in identifying, collecting, updating, disseminating, and selling, and other activities relating to, the operations of the database that are incurred by the entities carrying out those activities;
specify the frequency with which such database will be updated and specify the method by which such updating will take effect for purposes of compliance with the regulations prescribed under this subsection;
be designed to enable States to use the database mechanism selected by the Commission for purposes of administering or enforcing State law;
prohibit the use of such database for any purpose other than compliance with the requirements of this section and any such State law and specify methods for protection of the privacy rights of persons whose numbers are included in such database; and
require each common carrier providing services to any person for the purpose of making telephone solicitations to notify such person of the requirements of this section and the regulations thereunder.
(4) Considerations required for use of database method
If the Commission determines to require the database mechanism described in paragraph (3), the Commission shall—

ADD12

(A) in developing procedures for gaining access to the database, consider the different needs of telemarketers conducting business on a national, regional, State, or local level;
(B) develop a fee schedule or price structure for recouping the cost of such database that recognizes such differences and—
reflect the relative costs of providing a national, regional, State, or local list of phone numbers of subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations;
reflect the relative costs of providing such lists on paper or electronic media; and
not place an unreasonable financial burden on small businesses; and
(C) consider (i) whether the needs of telemarketers operating on a local basis could be met through special markings of area white pages directories, and (ii) if such directories are needed as an adjunct to database lists prepared by area code and local exchange prefix.
(5) Private right of action
A person who has received more than one telephone call within any 12-month period by or on behalf of the same entity in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection may, if otherwise permitted by the laws or rules of court of a State bring in an appropriate court of that State—
(A) an action based on a violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection to enjoin such violation,

ADD13

an action to recover for actual monetary loss from such a violation, or to receive up to $500 in damages for each such violation, whichever is greater, or
both such actions.
It shall be an affirmative defense in any action brought under this paragraph that the defendant has established and implemented, with due care, reasonable practices and procedures to effectively prevent telephone solicitations in violation of the regulations prescribed under this subsection. If the court finds that the defendant willfully or knowingly violated the regulations prescribed under this subsection, the court may, in its discretion, increase the amount of the award to an amount equal to not more than 3 times the amount available under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.

Artificial or prerecorded voice systems
The Commission shall prescribe technical and procedural standards for systems that are used to transmit any artificial or prerecorded voice message via telephone. Such standards shall require that—

ADD15

(B) any such system will automatically release the called party's line within 5 seconds of the time notification is transmitted to the system that the called party has hung up, to allow the called party's line to be used to make or receive other calls.
(e) Prohibition on provision of inaccurate caller identification information
In general
It shall be unlawful for any person within the United States, in connection with any telecommunications service or IP-enabled voice service, to cause any caller identification service to knowingly transmit misleading or inaccurate caller identification information with the intent to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value, unless such transmission is exempted pursuant to paragraph (3)(B).

If a sender obtains the facsimile number from the recipient’s own directory, advertisement, or Internet site, it will be presumed that the number was voluntarily made available for public distribution, unless such materials explicitly note that unsolicited advertisements are not accepted at the specified facsimile number. If a sender obtains the facsimile number from other sources, the sender must take reasonable steps to verify that the recipient agreed to make the number available for public distribution.
This clause shall not apply in the case of an unsolicited advertisement that is sent based on an established business relationship with the recipient that was in existence before July 9, 2005 if the sender also possessed the facsimile machine number of the recipient before July 9, 2005. There shall be a rebuttable presumption that if a valid established business relationship was formed prior to July 9, 2005, the sender possessed the facsimile number prior to such date as well; and
(iii) The advertisement contains a notice that informs the recipient of the ability and means to avoid future unsolicited advertisements. A notice contained in an advertisement complies with the requirements under this paragraph only if—

ADD31

(A) The notice is clear and conspicuous and on the first page of the advertisement;
(B) The notice states that the recipient may make a request to the sender of the advertisement not to send any future advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine or machines and that failure to comply, within 30 days, with such a request meeting the requirements under paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section is unlawful;
(C) The notice sets forth the requirements for an opt-out request under paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section;
(D) The notice includes—
A domestic contact telephone number and facsimile machine number for the recipient to transmit such a request to the sender; and
If neither the required telephone number nor facsimile machine number is a toll-free number, a separate cost-free mechanism including a Web site address or email address, for a recipient to transmit a request pursuant to such notice to the sender of the advertisement. A local telephone number also shall constitute a cost-free mechanism so long as recipients are local and will not incur any long distance or other separate charges for calls made to such number; and
(E) The telephone and facsimile numbers and cost-free
mechanism identified in the notice must permit an individual or business to make an opt-out request 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
(iv) A facsimile advertisement that is sent to a recipient that has provided prior express invitation or permission to the sender must

ADD32

include an opt-out notice that complies with the requirements in paragraph (a)(4)(iii) of this section.
(v) A request not to send future unsolicited advertisements to a telephone facsimile machine complies with the requirements under this subparagraph only if—
The request identifies the telephone number or numbers of the telephone facsimile machine or machines to which the request relates;
The request is made to the telephone number, facsimile number, Web site address or email address identified in the sender’s facsimile advertisement; and
The person making the request has not, subsequent to such request, provided express invitation or permission to the sender, in writing or otherwise, to send such advertisements to such person at such telephone facsimile machine.
(vi) A sender that receives a request not to send future unsolicited advertisements that complies with paragraph (a)(4)(v) of this section must honor that request within the shortest reasonable time from the date of such request, not to exceed 30 days, and is prohibited from sending unsolicited advertisements to the recipient unless the recipient subsequently provides prior express invitation or permission to the sender. The recipient’s opt-out request terminates the established business relationship exemption for purposes of sending future unsolicited advertisements. If such requests are recorded or maintained by a party other than the sender on whose behalf the unsolicited advertisement is sent, the sender will be liable for any failures to honor the opt-out request.

ADD33

(vii) A facsimile broadcaster will be liable for violations of paragraph (a)(4) of this section, including the inclusion of opt-out notices on unsolicited advertisements, if it demonstrates a high degree of involvement in, or actual notice of, the unlawful activity and fails to take steps to prevent such facsimile transmissions.
Use an automatic telephone dialing system in such a way that two or more telephone lines of a multi-line business are engaged simultaneously.
Disconnect an unanswered telemarketing call prior to at least 15 seconds or four (4) rings.
Abandon more than three percent of all telemarketing calls that are answered live by a person, as measured over a 30–day period for a single calling campaign. If a single calling campaign exceeds a 30– day period, the abandonment rate shall be calculated separately for each successive 30–day period or portion thereof that such calling campaign continues. A call is “abandoned” if it is not connected to a live sales representative within two (2) seconds of the called person’s completed greeting.
(i) Whenever a live sales representative is not available to speak with the person answering the call, within two (2) seconds after the called person’s completed greeting, the telemarketer or the seller must provide:
(A) A prerecorded identification and opt-out message that is limited to disclosing that the call was for “telemarketing purposes” and states the name of the business, entity, or individual on whose behalf the call was placed, and a telephone number for such business, entity, or individual that permits the called person to make a do-not-call request during regular business hours for the duration of the telemarketing campaign;

ADD34

provided, that, such telephone number may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges, and
(B) An automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism that enables the called person to make a do-not-call request prior to terminating the call, including brief explanatory instructions on how to use such mechanism. When the called person elects to opt-out using such mechanism, the mechanism must automatically record the called person’s number to the seller’s do-not-call list and immediately terminate the call.
A call for telemarketing purposes that delivers an artificial or prerecorded voice message to a residential telephone line or to any of the lines or telephone numbers described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii) of this section after the subscriber to such line has granted prior express written consent for the call to be made shall not be considered an abandoned call if the message begins within two (2) seconds of the called person’s completed greeting.
The seller or telemarketer must maintain records establishing compliance with paragraph (a)(7) of this section.
Calls made by or on behalf of tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are not covered by this paragraph (a)(7).
(8) Use any technology to dial any telephone number for the purpose of determining whether the line is a facsimile or voice line.
(b) All artificial or prerecorded voice telephone messages shall:
(1) At the beginning of the message, state clearly the identity of the business, individual, or other entity that is responsible for initiating the call. If a business is responsible for initiating the call, the name

ADD35

under which the entity is registered to conduct business with the State Corporation Commission (or comparable regulatory authority) must be stated;
During or after the message, state clearly the telephone number (other than that of the autodialer or prerecorded message player that placed the call) of such business, other entity, or individual. The telephone number provided may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges. For telemarketing messages to residential telephone subscribers, such telephone number must permit any individual to make a do-not-call request during regular business hours for the duration of the telemarketing campaign; and
In every case where the artificial or prerecorded voice telephone message includes or introduces an advertisement or constitutes telemarketing and is delivered to a residential telephone line or any of the lines or telephone numbers described in paragraphs (a)(1)(i) through (iii), provide an automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism for the called person to make a do-not-call request, including brief explanatory instructions on how to use such mechanism, within two (2) seconds of providing the identification information required in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. When the called person elects to opt out using such mechanism, the mechanism, must automatically record the called person’s number to the seller’s do-not-call list and immediately terminate the call. When the artificial or prerecorded voice telephone message is left on an answering machine or a voice mail service, such message must also provide a toll free number that enables the called person to call back at a later time and connect directly to the automated, interactive voice- and/or key press-activated opt-out mechanism and automatically record the called person’s number to the seller’s do-not-call list.

ADD36

(c) No person or entity shall initiate any telephone solicitation to:
Any residential telephone subscriber before the hour of 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m. (local time at the called party’s location), or
A residential telephone subscriber who has registered his or her telephone number on the national do-not-call registry of persons who do not wish to receive telephone solicitations that is maintained by the Federal Government. Such do-not-call registrations must be honored indefinitely, or until the registration is cancelled by the consumer or the telephone number is removed by the database administrator. Any person or entity making telephone solicitations (or on whose behalf telephone solicitations are made) will not be liable for violating this requirement if:
(i) It can demonstrate that the violation is the result of error and that as part of its routine business practice, it meets the following standards:
Written procedures. It has established and implemented written procedures to comply with the national do-not-call rules;
Training of personnel. It has trained its personnel, and any entity assisting in its compliance, in procedures established pursuant to the national do-not-call rules;
Recording. It has maintained and recorded a list of telephone numbers that the seller may not contact;
Accessing the national do-not-call database. It uses a process to prevent telephone solicitations to any telephone number on any list established pursuant to the do-not-call rules, employing a version of the national do-not-call registry obtained from the administrator of the registry no more than
ADD37

31 days prior to the date any call is made, and maintains records documenting this process.
Note to paragraph (c)(2)(i)(D): The requirement in paragraph 64.1200(c)(2)(i)(D) for persons or entities to employ a version of the national do-not-call registry obtained from the administrator no more than 31 days prior to the date any call is made is effective January 1, 2005. Until January 1, 2005, persons or entities must continue to employ a version of the registry obtained from the administrator of the registry no more than three months prior to the date any call is made.
(E) Purchasing the national do-not-call database. It uses a process to ensure that it does not sell, rent, lease, purchase or use the national do-not-call database, or any part thereof, for any purpose except compliance with this section and any such state or federal law to prevent telephone solicitations to telephone numbers registered on the national database. It purchases access to the relevant do-not-call data from the administrator of the national database and does not participate in any arrangement to share the cost of accessing the national database, including any arrangement with telemarketers who may not divide the costs to access the national database among various client sellers; or
It has obtained the subscriber’s prior express invitation or permission. Such permission must be evidenced by a signed, written agreement between the consumer and seller which states that the consumer agrees to be contacted by this seller and includes the telephone number to which the calls may be placed; or
The telemarketer making the call has a personal relationship with the recipient of the call.

ADD38

(d) No person or entity shall initiate any call for telemarketing purposes to a residential telephone subscriber unless such person or entity has instituted procedures for maintaining a list of persons who request not to receive telemarketing calls made by or on behalf of that person or entity. The procedures instituted must meet the following minimum standards:
Written policy. Persons or entities making calls for telemarketing purposes must have a written policy, available upon demand, for maintaining a do-not-call list.
Training of personnel engaged in telemarketing. Personnel engaged in any aspect of telemarketing must be informed and trained in the existence and use of the do-not-call list.
Recording, disclosure of do-not-call requests. If a person or entity making a call for telemarketing purposes (or on whose behalf such a call is made) receives a request from a residential telephone subscriber not to receive calls from that person or entity, the person or entity must record the request and place the subscriber’s name, if provided, and telephone number on the do-not-call list at the time the request is made. Persons or entities making calls for telemarketing purposes (or on whose behalf such calls are made) must honor a residential subscriber’s do-not-call request within a reasonable time from the date such request is made. This period may not exceed thirty days from the date of such request. If such requests are recorded or maintained by a party other than the person or entity on whose behalf the telemarketing call is made, the person or entity on whose behalf the telemarketing call is made will be liable for any failures to honor the do-not-call request. A person or entity making a call for telemarketing purposes must obtain a consumer’s prior express permission to share or forward the consumer’s request not to

ADD39

be called to a party other than the person or entity on whose behalf a telemarketing call is made or an affiliated entity.
Identification of sellers and telemarketers. A person or entity making a call for telemarketing purposes must provide the called party with the name of the individual caller, the name of the person or entity on whose behalf the call is being made, and a telephone number or address at which the person or entity may be contacted. The telephone number provided may not be a 900 number or any other number for which charges exceed local or long distance transmission charges.
Affiliated persons or entities. In the absence of a specific request by the subscriber to the contrary, a residential subscriber’s do-not-call request shall apply to the particular business entity making the call (or on whose behalf a call is made), and will not apply to affiliated entities unless the consumer reasonably would expect them to be included given the identification of the caller and the product being advertised.
Maintenance of do-not-call lists. A person or entity making calls for telemarketing purposes must maintain a record of a consumer’s request not to receive further telemarketing calls. A do-not-call request must be honored for 5 years from the time the request is made.
Tax-exempt nonprofit organizations are not required to comply with 64.1200(d).

Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991
AGENCY: Federal Communications Commission.
ACTION: Final rule.
SUMMARY: This Report and Order (R&O) amends parts 64 and 68 of the Commission's rules to establish procedures for avoiding unwanted telephone solicitations to residences, and to regulate the use of automatic telephone dialing systems (autodialers), prerecorded or artificial voice messages, and telephone facsimile machines. This action is pursuant to requirements of the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (TCPA) which amends Title II of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, by adding new section 227 and conforming section 2(b), and results from the Commission's analysis of comments to its Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published at 7 FCC Rcd 2736 (1992), (57 FR 18445, April 30, 1992). The TCPA, and corresponding rules of the Commission, are intended to protect the public from telemarketing calls which may pose a threat to health and safety or which otherwise may be considered by the called party to be undesirable, and to establish technical and procedural standards for the use of telephone facsimile machines.
EFFECTIVE DATE: December 20, 1992.

SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: This summarizes the Commission's R&O in the matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (CC Docket 92-90, FCC 92-443 adopted September 17, 1992 and released October 14, 1992). The R&O and supporting file are available for inspection and copying during the weekday hours of 9 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. in the Commission's Dockets Branch, room 239, 1919 M Street NW., Washington, DC, or copies may be purchased from the Commission's duplicating contractor, Downtown Copy Center, Inc., 1990 M Street NW., suite 640, Washington, DC 20036, phone (202) 452-1422. The R&O will be published in the FCC Record.
Paperwork Reduction Act Statement
The following recordkeeping requirement contained in the final rules has been submitted to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) for review and approval pursuant to requirements of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended:
Title: Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991.
OMB Number: None.
Action: Final rules; new collection.
Respondents: Businesses or others for profit, including small businesses. There is no reporting requirement; however, the R&O imposes a recordkeeping requirement on telephone solicitors to maintain lists of residential telephone subscribers who do not wish to be contacted by telephone.
Estimated Annual Burden: The annual burden to telephone solicitors are estimated to be 30,000 recordkeepers x 260 hours per recordkeeper = 7,800,000 recordkeeping hours. The public burden for the collection of

ADD53

information is estimated to average 260 hours per recordkeeper, including the time for reviewing instructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Send comments regarding burden estimates or any other aspect of the collection of information, including suggestions for reducing the burden, to the Federal Communications Commission, Paperwork Reduction Project, Records Management Division, room 416, Washington, DC 20554, and to the Office of Management and Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project, Washington, DC 20503.
Analysis of Proceeding
This summarizes the Commission's R&O in the matter of Rules and Regulations Implementing the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, Public Law 102-243, Dec. 20, 1991 (TCPA), CC Docket 92-90, FCC 92-443, adopted September 17, 1992 and released October 16, 1992.
The TCPA adds section 227 and conforms section 2(b) to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to impose restrictions on the use of automatic telephone dialing systems (“autodialers”), artificial or prerecorded messages, and telephone facsimile machines. 47 U.S.C. 227 and 152(b). The TCPA also requires that the Commission consider several methods to accommodate telephone subscribers who do not wish to receive unsolicited telephonic advertisements. The statute mandates that the Commission prescribe regulations implementing its requirements within nine months after the date of enactment, December 20, 1991. Accordingly, the Commission, on April 10, 1992, adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) (which included a copy of the TCPA) (7 FCC Rcd 2736 (1992), (57 FR 18445, April 30, 1992)) to which approximately 240 parties commented. Based on that record, the Commission has adopted this R&O.

ADD54

The rules we have adopted: (1) Prohibit calls using automatic telephone dialing systems or artificial or prerecorded voice (in the absence of an emergency or the prior express consent of the called party) to
emergency lines, health care facilities, radio common carriers or any number for which the called party is charged for the call; (2) prohibit calls using artificial or prerecorded voice calls to residences (absent an emergency or the prior express consent of the called party); (3) prohibit calls which transmit unsolicited advertisements to telephone facsimile machines; (4) require that telephone facsimile machines and autodialed artificial or prerecorded voice messages identify the sender of such transmissions; (5) require that artificial or prerecorded voice messages release the line of the called party within 5 seconds of notification that the called party has hung up; and (6) prohibit calls which simultaneously engage two or more lines of a multi-line business. Exemptions to the prohibition on prerecorded calls to residences apply if the call: (a) Is not made for a commercial purpose; (b) does not transmit an unsolicited advertisement; (c) is made by a calling party with whom the called party has an established business relationship; or (d) is made by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization. 47 CFR 64.1200(a)(2) and (c). In addition, telephone solicitations may not be made before the hour of 8 a.m. or after the hour of 9 p.m (local time at the called party's location). The rules further require that telephone solicitors maintain company-specific lists of residential subscribers who request not to receive further solicitations (company-specific do-not-call lists), thereby affording consumers the choice of which solicitors, if any, they will hear from by telephone. 47 CFR 64.1200(e) (iii) and (vi). The Commission believes that maintenance of such company-specific do-not-call lists, which many telemarketers already maintain, is the most effective and least costly means of preventing unwanted solicitations. Pursuant to requirements of the TCPA, the rules adopted balance the objectives of protecting consumers from nuisance calls while permitting legitimate telemarketing practices.

Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
Pursuant to the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, 5 U.S.C. 601, et seq., the Commission's final analysis in this R&O is as follows.
I. Need and Purpose of This Action
This R&O amends part 64 of the Commission's rules by adding § 64.1200 to restrict the use of automatic telephone dialing systems and artificial or prerecorded voice messages for telemarketing purposes or for transmitting unsolicited telephone facsimile advertisements. The rules require that persons or entities making telephone solicitations establish procedures to protect residential subscribers from unwanted solicitations, and set forth exemptions to certain prohibitions under this part. The R&O also amends part 68 of the rules by revising § 68.318(c)(2) and adding § 68.318(c)(3) to require that automatic telephone dialing systems delivering a recorded message release the called party's line within five seconds of notification of hang up by the called party, and to require that telephone facsimile machines manufactured on and after December 21, 1992 must clearly identify the sender of a facsimile message. The amendments implement the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, which inter alia, adds section 227 to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended 47 U.S.C. 227. The rules are intended to impose reasonable restrictions on autodialed or prerecorded voice telephone calls consistent with considerations regarding public health and safety and commercial speech and trade, and to allow consumers to avoid unwanted telephone solicitations without unduly limiting legitimate telemarketing practices.

Summary of Issues Raised by the Public Comments in Response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
No comments were submitted in direct response to the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis.
Significant Alternatives Considered
The NPRM in this proceeding requested comments on proposed regulations implementing the TCPA and comments on several proposals restricting telephone solicitations to residential telephone subscribers. The Commission has considered all comments and has adopted regulations to implement the prohibitions and technical requirements mandated by the TCPA as well as regulations which allow consumers to avoid unwanted telephone solicitations through placement on company-specific do-not-call lists. The Commission considers its R&O to be the most reasonable course of action under the mandate of section 227 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended.
Ordering Clauses
Accordingly, it is ordered, That, pursuant to authority contained in sections 1, 4(i), 4(j), 201-205, 218, and 227 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151, 154(i), 154(j), 201-205, 218 and 227, parts 64 and 68 of the Commission's Rules and Regulations Are Amended as set forth below, effective December 20, 1992.
It is further ordered, That, the Secretary shall cause a summary of this Report and Order to be published in the Federal Register which shall include a statement describing how members of the public may obtain the complete text of this Commission decision. The Secretary shall also provide a copy of this Report and Order to each state utility commission.
It is further ordered, That, this proceeding Is Terminated.

Synopsis
We revise the TCPA rules and adopt new rules to provide consumers with several options for avoiding unwanted telephone solicitations. Specifically, we establish with the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) a national do-not-call registry for consumers who wish to avoid unwanted telemarketing calls. The national do-not-call registry will supplement the current company-specific do-not-call rules for those consumers who wish to continue requesting that particular companies not call them. To address the more prevalent use of predictive dialers, we have determined that a telemarketer may abandon no more than three percent of calls answered by a person and must deliver a prerecorded identification message when abandoning a call. The new rules will also require all companies conducting telemarketing to transmit caller identification (caller ID) information, when available, and prohibit them from blocking such information. The Commission has revised its earlier determination that an established business relationship constitutes express invitation or permission to receive an unsolicited fax, and we have clarified when fax broadcasters are liable for the transmission of unlawful facsimile advertisements.
National Do-Not-Call List
Section 227. The TCPA requires the Commission to protect residential telephone subscribers' privacy rights to avoid receiving telephone solicitations to which they object. In so doing, 47 U.S.C. 227(c)(1) directs the Commission to “compare and evaluate alternative methods and procedures” including the use of electronic databases and other alternatives in protecting such privacy rights. Pursuant to 47 U.S.C. 227(c)(3), the Commission “may require the establishment and operation of a single national database to compile a list of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations, and to make that compiled list and parts thereof available

ADD67

for purchase.” If the Commission determines that adoption of a national database is warranted, 47 U.S.C. 227(c)(3) enumerates a number of specific statutory requirements that must be satisfied. Additionally, 47 U.S.C. 227(c)(4) requires the Commission to consider the different needs of telemarketers operating on a local or regional basis and small businesses. In addition to our general authority over interstate communications, section 2(b) of the Communications Act specifically provides the Commission with the authority to apply section 227 to intrastate communications.
We conclude that the record compiled in this proceeding supports the establishment of a single national database of telephone numbers of residential subscribers who object to receiving telephone solicitations. Consistent with the mandate of Congress in the Do-Not-Call Implementation Act (Do-Not-Call Act), the national do-not-call rules that we establish in this order “maximize consistency” with those of the FTC. The record clearly demonstrates widespread consumer dissatisfaction with the effectiveness of the current rules and network technologies available to protect consumers from unwanted telephone solicitations. Indeed, many consumers believe that with the advent of such technologies as predictive dialers that the vices of telemarketing have become inherent, while its virtues remain accidental. We have compared and evaluated alternative methods to a national do-not-call list for protecting consumer privacy rights and conclude that these alternatives are costly and/or ineffective for both telemarketers and consumers. See 47 U.S.C. 227(c)(1)(A).
A national do-not-call registry that is supplemented by the amendments made to our existing rules will provide consumers with a variety of options for managing telemarketing calls. Consumers may now: (1) Place their number on the national do-not-call list; (2) continue to make do-not-call requests of individual companies on a case-by-case basis; and/or (3) register on the national list, but provide specific

ADD68

companies with express permission to call them. Telemarketers may continue to call individuals who do not place their numbers on a do-not-call list and consumers with whom they have an established business relationship. We believe this result is consistent with Congress' directive in the TCPA that “[i]ndividuals” privacy rights, public safety interests, and commercial freedoms of speech and trade must be balanced in a way that protects the privacy of individuals and permits legitimate telemarketing practices.” See TCPA, Section 2(9), reprinted in 7 FCC Rcd at 2744.
5. We agree with Congress that consistency in the underlying regulations and administration of the national do-not-call registry is essential to avoid consumer confusion and regulatory uncertainty in the telemarketing industry. In so doing, we emphasize that there will be one centralized national do-not-call database of telephone numbers. The FTC has set up and will maintain the national database, while both agencies will coordinate enforcement efforts pursuant to a forthcoming Memorandum of Understanding. The states will also play an important role in the enforcement of the do-not-call rules. The FTC has received funding approval from Congress to begin implementation of the national do-not-call registry. Because the FTC lacks jurisdiction over certain entities, including common carriers, banks, insurance companies, and airlines, those entities would be allowed to continue calling individuals on the FTC's list absent FCC action exercising our broad authority given by Congress over telemarketers. In addition, the FTC's jurisdiction does not extend to intrastate activities. Action by this Commission to adopt a national do-not-call list, as permitted by the TCPA, requires all commercial telemarketers to comply with the national do-not-call requirements, thereby providing more comprehensive protections to consumers and consistent treatment of telemarketers.
